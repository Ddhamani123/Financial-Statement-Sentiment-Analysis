ITEM 1. BUSINESS

BUSINESS OF BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION

GENERAL

     BankUnited Financial Corporation (the "Company" or "BankUnited") is a
Florida corporation and the savings and loan holding company for BankUnited, FSB
(the "Bank"). The Company currently has twenty-five branch offices, twenty-four
in southeast and one in southwest Florida and anticipates opening additional
branch offices in 1999 in its market area. The Company's business has
traditionally consisted of attracting deposits from the general public and using
those deposits, together with borrowings and other funds, to purchase nationwide
and to originate in Florida single-family residential mortgage loans, and to a
lesser extent, to purchase and originate commercial real estate, commercial
business and consumer loans. The Company also invests in other permitted
investments. The Company's revenues are derived principally from interest earned
on loans, mortgage-backed securities and investments. The Company's primary
expenses arise from interest paid on deposits and borrowings and non-interest
operating expenses incurred in operations.

     During fiscal 1999, the Company expects to place increased emphasis on
retail and commercial branches and retail and correspondent lending, with a view
towards increasing the Company's margins and generating increased non-interest
income. It is also anticipated that the rapid expansion experienced during the
1998 fiscal year will be moderated during the 1999 fiscal year.

     In connection with its emphasis on retail and commercial banking, as of
December 1, 1998, the Company and the Bank appointed a new President and Chief
Operating Officer who was formerly responsible for the Miami-Dade and Monroe
County operations of the largest commercial bank operating in South Florida.

     The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the "FHLB")
and is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC"). Deposits at the Bank are insured by the Savings
Association Insurance Fund to the maximum extent permitted by law.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     When used in this Form 10-K or future filings by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, in the Company's press releases or other
public or shareholder communications, or in oral statements made with the
approval of an authorized executive officer, the word or phrases "will likely
result", "expect", "will continue", "anticipate", "estimate", "project",
"believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on
any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made, and
to advise readers that various factors, including general economic factors and
conditions, changes in levels of market interest rates, credit risks of lending
activities, competitive and regulatory factors, and expansion strategies could
affect the Company's financial performance and could cause the Company's actual
results for future periods to differ materially from those anticipated or
projected.

     The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation,
to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any
forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

MARKET AREA AND COMPETITION

     The Company conducts operations in Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Collier
counties ("South Florida") which geographic region, at June 30, 1998, had a
total of approximately $79.7 billion in deposits at commercial banks and savings
institutions (42.1% of the total of $189.3 billion of deposits in Florida). The
Company intends to continue to establish or acquire branch offices in its market
area and may expand into other parts of Florida.


                                        1
<PAGE>

     The Company encounters strong competition in attracting deposits and in its
lending activities. Its most direct competition for deposits historically has
been from commercial banks, brokerage houses, other savings associations, and
credit unions located in the Company's market area, and the Company expects
continued strong competition from such financial institutions in the foreseeable
future. The Company also competes in its market area with the branch offices of
several super-regional commercial banks and savings associations that are
substantially larger and have more extensive operations than the Company. In
addition, many financial institutions formerly independent and operating in
South Florida have recently been acquired by larger institutions headquartered
out of state. The Company's goal is to compete for savings and other deposits by
offering depositors a higher level of personal service, together with a wide
range of deposit products offered at competitive rates. The Company believes
that this strategy will enable it to attract depositors as the number of local
institutions declines and depositors who desire more personal service,
particularly retirees, relocate their accounts.

     The competition in originating real estate and other loans comes
principally from commercial banks, mortgage banking companies and other savings
associations. The Company competes for loan originations primarily through the
interest rates and loan fees which it charges, the types of loans which it
offers, and the efficiency and quality of service which it provides. The Company
purchases residential first mortgage loans in the existing secondary mortgage
market and competes with other mortgage purchasers primarily on the basis of
price. While the Company has been, and intends to continue to be, primarily a
residential lender, the Company has recently increased its emphasis on
commercial real estate, construction and commercial lending, as discussed more
fully below. Factors that affect competition in lending include general and
local economic conditions, current interest rates and volatility of the mortgage
markets. As with its deposit products, the Company's strategy is to promote its
higher level of personal service and to position itself as a small- to
middle-market lender servicing businesses left underserved by larger
institutions.

     Management's strategy has included and continues to include evaluating
market needs and offering products to meet those needs. The Company will
continue to offer products and services that will allow it to control the growth
of its assets and liabilities. These new products and services will allow the
Company to properly position itself to its customers as a community bank.

FACTORS AFFECTING EARNINGS

     The results of the Company's operations are affected by many factors beyond
the Company's control, including general economic conditions and the related
monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Earnings generated from
lending activities are affected by the demand for mortgages and other types of
loans, which is in turn affected by the interest rates at which such loans may
be offered, and other factors affecting the supply of housing and the
availability of funds. Sources and costs of funds, principally deposits and
borrowings, are influenced by yields available on competing investments and by
general market rates of interest.

     ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT. The Company's net earnings depend primarily
on its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income
received on its interest-earning assets (principally loans, short-term and
long-term investments, and mortgage-backed securities) and interest expense paid
on its interest-bearing liabilities (principally deposits, FHLB advances, and
trust preferred securities). The Company's net interest income is significantly
affected by (i) the difference between yields received on its interest-earning
assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities (the "interest
rate spread") and (ii) the relative amounts of its interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing


                                        2
<PAGE>

liabilities. When interest-earning assets equal or exceed interest-bearing
liabilities, any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest
income. When such liabilities exceed such assets, the greater the positive
interest rate spread must be in order to produce net interest income.
Non-interest sources of income and non-interest expenses also affect the
Company's net income. The higher non-interest expenses are, the greater the
positive interest rate spread and/or non-interest sources of income must be to
produce net income.

     The Company's exposure to interest rate risk is measured as the sensitivity
of the value of its financial instruments and net interest income to changes in
the level of interest rates. Generally, interest rate risk for a financial
institution results from differences in repricing intervals or maturities
between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. When such
differences exist, a change in the level of interest rates will most likely
result in an increase or decrease in net interest income. The Company's ability
to manage interest rate risk depends upon a number of factors, including
competition for loans and deposits in its market area and conditions prevailing
in the secondary mortgage market.

     In the current interest rate environment, when long-term interest rates are
generally low on a historical basis and the spread between short-term rates and
long-term rates is relatively narrow, prepayments of adjustable rate and higher
fixed-rate mortgages tend to accelerate. As a result of the historically high
levels of prepayments, the results of operations for the year ended September
30, 1998 reflect an acceleration in the amortization of purchase premiums on
loans and mortgage-backed securities from $1.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 1997 to $11.4 million for the year ended September 30, 1998. In
turn, this caused a corresponding reduction in net interest income. To reduce
the adverse impact of declining market interest rates on the Company's net
interest income, the Company began to emphasize originating and purchasing
fixed-rate loans in the latter half of the fiscal year.

     The Company has rate-sensitive (maturing or subject to repricing within one
year) assets that exceed its rate-sensitive liabilities, resulting in a positive
cumulative one-year gap position of 4.58% of total assets as of September 30,
1998. This imbalance, when coupled with the deregulation of the restrictions
previously imposed on the types of savings products that financial institutions
are permitted to offer, subjects the Company's earnings to change based on
fluctuations in interest rates. The Company constantly attempts to reduce the
sensitivity of its earnings to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the
average maturities of its interest-bearing liabilities and interest-earning
assets.

     The Company currently utilizes derivative instruments on a limited basis to
hedge the interest rate risks of certain financial instruments. Interest Rate
Cap contracts have been acquired by the Company to hedge the risk on an increase
in market interest rates for variable rate sources of funds which are partially
funding financial instruments which have interest rate terms which are fixed for
certain periods of time (see Note 17 "Commitments and Contingencies" of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
Interest Rate Cap contracts). The Interest Rate Cap contracts will be treated as
cash flow hedges and it is anticipated that any change in their fair value will
be substantially offset by an opposite change in the fair value of the financial
instruments designated in the hedge transaction.

     There can be no assurance, however, of the degree to which the Company will
be able to effectively maintain the balance of its short-term interest-earning
assets as compared to its short-term interest-bearing liabilities and manage the
risks to liquidity associated therewith.

(1)      In preparing the table above, certain assumptions have been made with
         regard to the repricing or maturity of certain assets and liabilities.
         Assumptions as to prepayments on first and second mortgage loans and
         mortgage-backed securities were obtained from prepayment rate tables
         that provide assumptions correlating to recent actual repricing
         experienced in the marketplace. Assumptions have also been made with
         regard to payments on tax certificates based on historical experience.
         Money market, NOW and passbook accounts are assumed to decay based upon
         duration estimates determined by management. The rates paid in these
         accounts, however, are determined by management based on market
         conditions and other factors and may reprice more slowly than assumed.
         All other assets and liabilities have been repriced based on the
         earlier of repricing or contractual maturity. The mortgage prepayment
         rate tables, deposit decay rates and the historical assumptions used
         regarding payments on tax certificates should not be regarded as
         indicative of the actual repricing that may be experienced by the
         Company

         YIELDS EARNED AND RATES PAID. The following table sets forth certain
information relating to the categories of the Company's interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. All yield and rate
information is calculated on an annualized basis by dividing the income or
expense item for the period by the average balances during the period of the
appropriate balance sheet item. Net interest margin is calculated by dividing
net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Non-accrual loans are
included for the appropriate periods, whereas recognition of interest on such
loans is discontinued and any remaining accrued interest receivable is reversed,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and federal
regulations. The yields and net interest margins appearing in the following
table have been calculated on a pre-tax basis.

     RATE/VOLUME ANALYSIS. The following table presents, for the periods
indicated, the changes in interest income and the changes in interest expense
attributable to the changes in interest rates and the changes in the volume of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For each category of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is
provided on changes attributable to: (i) changes in volume (change in volume
multiplied by prior year rate); (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied
by prior year volume); (iii) changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied
by change in volume); and (iv) total changes.

LENDING ACTIVITIES

     The Company focuses its lending activity on purchasing and originating
single-family residential mortgage loans. The Company's lending strategy also
includes expanding its commercial real estate, commercial business, and real
estate construction lending. The Company also currently offers consumer loans,
such as automobile loans and boat loans.

     LOAN PORTFOLIO. The Company's loan portfolio primarily consists of
adjustable-rate mortgage loans ("ARMs") and fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by
one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate. As of September 30,
1998, the Company's loan portfolio totaled $3.0 billion, of which $2.8 billion
or 91.5 % consisted of one-to-four family residential first mortgages. At the
present time, the Company's residential real estate loans are primarily
"conventional" loans not insured by the Federal Housing Administration (the
"FHA") or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (the "VA"). The Company is,
however, approved to originate FHA and VA loans. As of September 30, 1998, the
remainder of the Company's loan portfolio consisted of $145.9 million of
commercial real estate loans (4.8 % of total loans); five-or-more units
residential real estate loans of $24.4 million (0.8 % of total loans, net); $4.3
million of second mortgage loans (0.1 % of total loans, net); $30.4 million of
consumer loans (1.0% of total loans, net); $15.6 million of commercial business
loans (0.5 % of total loans, net); and $13.2 million of other loans (0.4% of
total loans, net).

     At September 30, 1998, the Company's loan portfolio included $199.4
million, or 6.6% of the Company's total loans receivable, net, of residential
mortgage loans to non-resident aliens. See "Residential Mortgage Loan Purchases
and Originations" for additional information on the Company's loans to
non-resident aliens.

     Set forth below is a table showing the Company's loan origination, purchase
and sale activity for the periods indicated.

     Applicable regulations permit the Company to engage in various categories
of secured and unsecured commercial and consumer lending, in addition to
residential real estate financing, subject to limitations on the percentage of
total assets attributable to certain categories of loans. An additional
limitation imposed by regulation requires that certain types of loans only be
made in aggregate amounts that do not exceed specified percentages of the
institution's capital. As of September 30, 1998, 18.9% of the Company's gross
loans receivable (15.3% of total assets) were secured by properties located in
Florida and 16.5 % of gross loans receivable (13.3% of total assets) were
secured by properties located in California. Because of this concentration,
regional economic circumstances in those states could affect the level of the
Company's non-performing loans.

     RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASES AND ORIGINATIONS. The Company's lending
primarily involves purchasing in the secondary mortgage market and originating
loans secured by first mortgages on real estate improved with single-family
dwellings. The Company's first mortgage loans purchased or originated are
generally repayable over 15 or 30 years. Additionally, the Company offers second
mortgage residential loans with maturities ranging from five to 15 years.
Residential loans typically remain outstanding for shorter periods than their
contractual maturities because borrowers prepay the loans in full upon sale of
the mortgaged property or upon refinancing of the original loan.

     The Company's ARMs generally have interest rates that adjust semi-annually,
annually and, to a lesser extent, after a 3, 5 or 7 year fixed-rate term with
subsequent annual interest rate adjustments at a margin over the weekly average
yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year
published by the Federal Reserve. The maximum interest rate adjustment of the
Company's ARMs is generally 1% semi-annually and 6% over the life of the loan,
above or below the initial rate on the loan for semi-annual adjustables, or 2%
annually and 6% over the life of the loan, above or below the initial rate on
the loan for annual adjustables.

     The Company has purchased and originated loans with "teaser" rates that are
below market rates during an initial period after the loan is originated. The
teaser rate loans are generally tied to the constant maturity of one year
published by the Federal Reserve. For loans with teaser rates, the borrower's
ability to repay is determined by reference to the teaser rate plus 2%. As of
September 30, 1998 there were approximately $492.4 million of loans with teaser
rates.

     Applicable regulations permit the Company to lend up to 100% of the
appraised value of the real property securing a loan ("loan-to-value ratio").
When terms are favorable, the Company may purchase or originate single-family
mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios between 80% and 95%. In most of these
cases, the Company will, as a matter of policy, require the borrower to obtain
private mortgage insurance which insures that portion of the loan exceeding the
80% loan-to-value ratio, thereby reducing the risk to no more than 80% of
appraised value.

     The Company generally applies the same underwriting criteria to residential
mortgage loans purchased or originated. In its loan purchases, the Company
generally reserves the right to reject particular loans from a loan package
being purchased and does reject loans in a package that do not meet its
commitment criteria. In determining whether to purchase or originate a loan, the
Company assesses both the borrower's ability to repay the loan and the adequacy
of the proposed collateral. On originations, the Company obtains appraisals of
the property securing the loan. On purchases, the Company reviews the appraisal
obtained by the loan seller or originator and, based upon pre-determined
criteria and review of the loan file, may arrange for an updated review
appraisal before purchasing the loan. An appraisal will generally be ordered if
the property securing the loan is located in a designated area (such as a
geographic region known for fluctuating property values), if the loan size or
loan -to-value ratio meets certain thresholds, or if an underwriter or other
Bank officer, upon review of the loan file, determines that it is prudent to
order an appraisal. On purchases and originations, the Company reviews
information concerning the income, financial condition, employment and credit
history of the applicant. On purchases, the Company generally obtains a credit
report on the borrower separate from that provided by the loan seller.


                                       10
<PAGE>


     The Company has adopted written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards
for use in the underwriting and review of every loan considered for origination
or purchase. These underwriting standards are reviewed and approved annually by
the Company's Board of Directors. The Company's underwriting standards for
residential mortgage loans generally conform to standards established by Federal
National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (the "FHLMC"), except that the Company's underwriting standards
allow it to make loans (i) to non-resident aliens, as discussed below, (ii)
exceeding the FHMA or FHLMC limits, and (iii) in cases where specific
characteristics of the loan or borrower may compensate for the lack of
conformity with the FNMA or FHLMC criteria. A loan application is obtained or
reviewed by the Company's underwriters to determine the borrower's ability to
repay, and confirmation of the more significant information is obtained through
the use of credit reports, financial statements, and employment and other
verifications.

     The Company generally uses appraisals to determine the value of collateral
for all loans it originates. When originating a real estate mortgage loan, the
Company obtains a new appraisal of the property from an independent third party
to determine the adequacy of the collateral, and such appraisal is confirmed by
one of the underwriters. With respect to a substantial percentage of loans
purchased, the collateral value is confirmed by reference to a review appraisal.
Otherwise, the collateral value is determined by reference to the documentation
contained in the original file. Borrowers are required to obtain casualty
insurance and, if applicable, flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the
outstanding loan balance or the maximum amount allowed by law.

     The Company also requires that a survey be conducted and title insurance be
obtained, insuring the priority of its mortgage lien. Pursuant to its
underwriting standards, the Company generally requires private mortgage
insurance policies on newly originated mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios
greater than 80%. All loans are reviewed by the Company's underwriters to ensure
that its guidelines are met or that waivers are obtained in limited situations
where offsetting factors exist.

     With regard to loan purchases, a legal review of every loan file is
conducted to determine the adequacy of the legal documentation. The Company
receives various representations and warranties from the sellers of the loans
regarding the quality and characteristics of the loans.

     At September 30, 1998, approximately $199.4 million, or 6.6%, of the
Company's gross loans receivable were first mortgage loans to non-resident
aliens secured by single-family residences located in Florida. These loans are
primarily originated by the Company in a manner similar to that described above
for other residential loans. Loans to non-resident aliens generally afford the
Company an opportunity to receive rates of interest higher than those available
from other single-family residential loans. Nevertheless, certain aspects of
such loans may involve a greater degree of risk than conforming single-family
residential mortgage loans. The ability to obtain access to the borrower is more
limited for non-resident aliens, as is the ability to attach or verify assets
located in foreign countries. The Company has attempted to minimize these risks
through its underwriting standards for such loans (including generally lower
loan-to-value ratios and qualification based on verifiable assets located in the
United States).

     The Company has also established a correspondent mortgage banking operation
for the origination of single-family residential mortgage loans in its market
area. This correspondent operation consists of a network of mortgage brokers and
lenders in South Florida that generate mortgage loans for the Company.
Originations in the correspondent program, together with branch lending, reached
$312.7 million in fiscal 1998 and $159.5 million for the year ended September
30, 1997.

     Beginning in the Company's fiscal 1997 fourth quarter, management began a
program to sell substantially all of the Company's internally generated
residential loans. These loans are classified as held for sale when originated
and if, after attempting to market the loans, management determines that certain
loans are unable to be packaged into saleable pools, the Company may transfer
such loans to its portfolio at the lower of cost or market. During the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1998 and the fiscal 1997 fourth quarter, residential
loans totaling $173.5 million and $30.1 million, respectively, were sold for a
gain of $4.0 million and $523,000, respectively. In addition, as part of
starting this program, the Company reclassified $93.5 million of its internally
generated portfolio of residential loans as held for sale in the fiscal 1997
fourth quarter. Loans held for sale as of September 30, 1998 were $172.4
million.

     COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING. The Company's commercial real estate
lending division originates or purchases multi-family and commercial real estate
loans from approximately $250,000 to $5.0 million. The Company's strategy is to
promote commercial lending together with private banking, as both areas seek to
develop long-term relationships with select businesses, real estate borrowers,
and professionals. At September 30, 1998, the Company had $145.8 million of
commercial real estate loans, representing a total of 4.8% of the Company's loan
portfolio before net items. The Company's commercial real estate loan portfolio
includes loans secured by apartment buildings, office buildings, warehouses,
retail stores and other properties, which are located in the Company's primary
market area. Commercial real estate loans generally are originated in amounts up
to 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. In determining
whether to originate or purchase multi-family or commercial real estate loans,
the Company also considers such factors as the financial condition of the
borrower and the debt service coverage of the property. Commercial real estate
loans are made at both fixed and adjustable interest rates for terms of up to 10
years.

     REAL ESTATE CONSTRUCTION LENDING. The Company makes real estate
construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences, as
well as to builders and real estate developers for the construction of
one-to-four-family residences and commercial and multi-family real estate. At
September 30, 1998, the Company had $7.8 million of construction loans
representing a total of 0.2% of the Company's loan portfolio before net items.

     COMMERCIAL BUSINESS LENDING. Commercial business loans totaled $15.6
million as of September 30, 1998 representing 0.5 % of total loans. In its
commercial business loan underwriting, the Company evaluates the value of the
collateral securing the loan and assesses the borrower's creditworthiness and
ability to repay. While commercial business loans generally are made for shorter
terms and at higher yields than one-to-four-family residential loans, such loans
generally involve a higher level of risk than one-to-four-family residential
loans because the risk of borrower default is greater and the collateral may be
more difficult to liquidate and more likely to decline in value.

     LOAN PORTFOLIO QUALITY. Federal regulations require a savings institution
to review its assets on a regular basis and, if appropriate, to classify assets
as "substandard," "doubtful," or "loss" depending on the likelihood of loss.
General allowances for loan losses are required to be established for assets
classified as substandard or doubtful. For assets classified as loss, the
institution must either establish specific allowances equal to the amount
classified as a loss or charge off such amount. Assets that do not require
classification as substandard but that possess credit deficiencies or potential
weaknesses deserving management's close attention are required to be designated
as "special mention." The deputy director of the appropriate OTS regional office
may approve, disapprove or modify any classifications of assets and any
allowance for loan losses established.

     Additionally, under standard banking practices, an institution's asset
quality is also measured by the level of non-performing loans in the
institution's portfolio. Non-performing loans consist of (i) non-accrual loans;
(ii) loans that are more than 90 days contractually past due as to interest or
principal but that are well-secured and in the process of collection or renewal
in the normal course of business; and (iii) loans that have been renegotiated to
provide a deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the
financial condition of the borrower. The Company issues delinquency notices to
borrowers when loans are 30 or more days past due. The Company places
conventional mortgage loans on non-accrual status when more than 90 days past
due, unless the loan is fully secured and in the process of collection. When a
loan is placed on non-accrual status, the Company reverses all accrued and

     Historically, recoveries of charged off loans have been minimal since
charged off loans have been primarily one-to-four family residential loans and
typically the only substantial asset available to the Company is the real estate
securing the loan which is acquired through foreclosure and sold. However, in
its fiscal year ended September 30, 1996, the Company received a recovery of
approximately $1.0 million as settlement of litigation the Company initiated
against a seller of residential mortgage loans. The Company is not aware of any
significant liability related to REO or loans that may be foreclosed.

INVESTMENTS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

     The Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of
federal agency securities, FHLB overnight deposits, securities purchased under
agreements to resell, trust preferred securities and tax certificates. Federal
regulations limit the instruments in which the Company may invest its funds. The
Company's current investment policy permits purchases only of investments (with
the exception of tax certificates) rated in one of the three highest grades by a
nationally recognized rating agency and does not permit purchases of securities
of non-investment grade quality (such as so-called "junk bonds").

     The Company's portfolio also includes tax certificates issued by various
counties in the State of Florida. Tax certificates represent tax obligations
that are auctioned by county taxing authorities on an annual basis in order to
collect delinquent real estate taxes. Although tax certificates have no stated
maturity, the certificate holder has the right to collect the delinquent tax
amount, plus interest, and can file for a tax deed if the delinquent tax amount
is unpaid at the end of two years. Tax certificates have a claim superior to
most other liens. If the holder does not file for deed within seven years, the
certificate becomes null and void. The Company has adopted detailed policies
with regard to its investment in tax certificates, which specify due diligence
procedures, purchasing procedures (including parameters for the location, type
and size of tax certificates acceptable for purchase) and procedures for
managing the portfolio after acquisition.

     Mortgage-backed securities are primarily acquired for their liquidity,
yield, and credit characteristics. Such securities may be used as collateral for
borrowing or pledged as collateral for certain deposits, including public funds
deposits. Mortgage-backed securities acquired include fixed and adjustable rate
agency securities (GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC), private issue securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations.

     Also included in the Company's investment portfolio are trust preferred
securities issued by FDIC-insured financial institutions or their holding
companies. Such securities are primarily acquired for their liquidity and yield
characteristics.

MORTGAGE LOAN SERVICING

     Prior to November 1996, the Company primarily serviced mortgage loans only
for its portfolio. With the acquisition of Suncoast on November 15, 1996, the
Company acquired a servicing portfolio consisting of 19,487 loans owned by
outside investors. In addition, the Company retains the servicing on the
internally generated residential loans that are sold in connection with the loan
sales program initiated by management in the Company's 1997 fiscal fourth
quarter.

     Servicing agreements generally provide for loan servicing fees ranging from
0.25% to 0.50% per annum of the declining principal amount of the loans, plus
any late charges or other ancillary fees. Loan servicing fees for loans serviced
under mortgage-backed securities programs are either subject to negotiation with
the sponsoring agency or in certain instances set by the sponsoring agency.
Servicing fees for loans sold to private investors are determined by agreement
with the investor. Income from servicing is calculated based upon the
contractual servicing fee, net of amortization of the carrying value of the loan
servicing rights.

     The Company is subject to certain costs and risks related to servicing
delinquent loans. Servicing agreements relating to the mortgage-backed security
programs of FNMA and FHLMC require the servicer to advance funds to make
scheduled payments of interest, taxes and insurance, and in some instances
principal, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. However,
the Company recovers substantially all of the advanced funds upon cure of
default by the borrower, or through


                                       15
<PAGE>

foreclosure proceedings and claims against agencies or companies that have
insured or guaranteed the loans. Certain servicing agreements for loans sold
directly to other investors require the Company to remit funds to the loan
purchaser only upon receipt of payments from the borrower and, accordingly, the
investor bears the risk of loss. The Company, however, is subject to the risk
that declines in the market rates of interest for mortgage loans or other
economic conditions will result in a revaluation of its servicing assets as
borrowers refinance or otherwise prepay higher interest rate loans.

     The following table sets forth, by category of investor, the composition of
the acquired servicing portfolios of the Company as of the dates indicated:

SOURCES OF FUNDS

     The Company's primary sources of funds for its investment and lending
activities are customer deposits, loan repayments, funds from operations, the
Company's capital (including trust preferred securities) and FHLB advances.

     DEPOSITS. The Company offers a full variety of deposit accounts ranging
from passbook accounts to certificates of deposit with maturities of up to five
years. The Company also offers transaction accounts, which include commercial
checking accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts, super NOW
accounts and money market deposit accounts. The rates paid on deposits are
established periodically by management based on the Company's need for funds and
the rates being offered by the Company's competitors with the goal of remaining
competitive without offering the highest rates in the market area. In addition,
as of September 30, 1998, the Company had $75.0 million in brokered certificates
of deposits.

     The Company has placed increasing reliance on passbook accounts, money
market accounts, certificates of deposit and other savings alternatives that are
more responsive to market conditions than long-term, fixed-rate certificates.
While market-sensitive savings instruments permit the Company to reduce its cost
of funds during periods of declining interest rates, such savings instruments
also increase the Company's vulnerability to periods of high interest rates.
There are no regulatory interest rate ceilings on the Company's accounts.

     Included in the table of jumbo certificates accounts above, are $86.2
million in certificates of deposit issued to the State of Florida, referred to
as public funds, where $76.6 million have interest rates ranging from 5.05% to
5.63% and $10.0 million have interest rates of 4.80%.

     Of the Company's total deposits, excluding public funds, at September 30,
1998, 1997, and 1996, 12.3%, 11.5%, and 10.5%, respectively, were deposits of
$100,000 or more issued to the general public. Although jumbo certificates of
deposit are generally more rate sensitive than smaller size deposits, management
believes that the Company will retain these deposits.

     In fiscal 1998, the Company opened six new branch offices and acquired four
branch offices from Central. The branches acquired from Consumers were closed
and the deposits were consolidated with an existing branch of the Company. In
fiscal 1999, the Company intends to open several new branch offices including
two that are scheduled to be opened in the first quarter of 1999.

     BORROWINGS. When the Company's primary sources of funds are not sufficient
to meet deposit outflows, loan originations and purchases and other cash
requirements, the Company may borrow funds from the FHLB of Atlanta and from
other sources. The FHLB system acts as an additional source of funding for
savings institutions. In addition, the Company uses subordinated notes,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and trust preferred securities in
order to increase available funds.

     FHLB borrowings, known as "advances," are made on a secured basis, and the
terms and rates charged for FHLB advances vary in response to general economic
conditions. As a shareholder of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is authorized to
apply for advances from this bank. A wide variety of borrowing plans are offered
by the FHLB of Atlanta, each with its own maturity and interest rate. The FHLB
of Atlanta will consider various factors, including an institution's regulatory
capital position, net income, quality and composition of assets, lending
policies and practices, and level of current borrowings from all sources, in
determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution. In addition, an
institution that fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test may have
restrictions imposed on its ability to obtain FHLB advances. The Bank currently
meets the qualified thrift lender test.

     During the 1997 and 1998 fiscal years, the Company issued an aggregate of
$227.2 million in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, which were
purchased by its Delaware trust subsidiaries primarily with proceeds from the
sale of trust preferred securities. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for a description of the Junior Subordinated Deferrable
Interest Debentures and the trust preferred securities.

     During November 1998, the Bank established a program to issue up to $500
million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes backed by an irrevocable
standby letter of credit from the FHLB of Atlanta. The notes, none of which have
been issued, may have either a fixed or variable rate of interest determined at
the time of issuance and will mature no sooner than 9 months and no more than 10
years from the date of issuance. The Bank intends to use the net proceeds from
the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes that will ultimately
promote home financing or other housing activity and assist the Bank's
asset/liability management. The notes have been rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. and "AAA" by Standard and Poor's Rating Services.

REGULATION

The following discussion is a summary of the significant provisions of the
banking laws and regulations which affect the Company and the Bank.

     THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS REFORM, RECOVERY, AND ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1989.
The FIRREA, which was enacted in response to concerns regarding the soundness of
the thrift industry limits savings institutions' business activities, and
establishes their regulatory capital requirements. The FIRREA establishes the
OTS as the primary federal regulator for savings institutions. Deposits at the
Bank are insured through the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF"), a
separate fund managed by the FDIC for institutions whose deposits were formerly
insured by the FSLIC. Regulatory functions relating to deposit insurance are
generally exercised by the FDIC and the FDIC also manages conservatorships and
receiverships of insolvent thrifts.

     THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991. The
FDICIA authorizes regulators to take prompt corrective action to solve the
problems of critically undercapitalized institutions. As a result, the banking
regulators are required to take certain supervisory actions against
undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which increases as an
institution's level of capitalization decreases. Pursuant to the FDICIA, the
federal banking agencies have established the levels at which an insured
institution is considered to be "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized,"
"undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically
undercapitalized." See "--Savings Institution Regulations--Prompt Corrective
Action" below for a discussion of the applicable capital levels.

     The FDICIA also requires that the federal banking agencies include
components for interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk and the risk of
non-traditional activities in their risk-based capital requirements. See
"--Savings Institution Regulations--Regulatory Capital Requirements" below for a
description of the OTS rule that incorporates an interest rate risk component in
the risk-based capital requirement. Although implementation of this rule has
been postponed indefinitely.

     In addition, the FDICIA requires each federal banking agency to have
standards relating to internal controls, information systems, and internal audit
systems that are designed to assess the financial condition and management of
the institution; loan documentation; credit underwriting; interest rate
exposure; asset growth; and compensation, fees and benefits. The FDICIA also
establishes the qualified thrift lender ("QTL") investment percentage applicable
to SAIF-insured institutions, (see "--Savings


                                       20
<PAGE>

Institution Regulations--Qualified Thrift Lender Test" below) and pursuant to
the FDICIA, a risk based assessment system for insured depository institutions
(see "--Savings Institution Regulations--Insurance of Accounts" below) has been
implemented. The FDICIA further requires annual on-site full examinations of
depository institutions, with certain exceptions, and annual reports on
institutions' financial and management controls.

     THE RIEGLE-NEAL INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING EFFICIENCY ACT OF 1994.
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (the
"Interstate Branching Act") , which was enacted in September 1994, generally
does not directly affect savings associations, except for a provision that
allows an insured savings association that was an affiliate of a bank on July 1,
1994, to act as the bank's agent as though it were an insured bank affiliate of
the bank.

SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS

     TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Company is a unitary savings and loan
holding company and is subject to the OTS regulations, examination, supervision
and reporting requirements pursuant to certain provisions of the Home Owners'
Loan Act (the "HOLA") and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. As an insured
institution and a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank is
subject to restrictions in its dealings with companies that are "affiliates" of
the Company under the HOLA, certain provisions of the Federal Reserve Act that
were made applicable to savings institutions by the FIRREA, and the OTS
regulations.

     As a result of the FIRREA, savings institutions' transactions with their
affiliates are subject to the limitations set forth in the HOLA and the OTS
regulations, which incorporate Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal
Reserve Act and Regulation O adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"). Under Section 23A, an "affiliate"
of an institution is defined generally as (i) any company that controls the
institution and any other company that is controlled by the Company that
controls the institution, (ii) any company that is controlled by the
shareholders who control the institution or any company that controls the
institution, or (iii) any company that is determined by regulation or order to
have a relationship with the institution (or any subsidiary or affiliate of the
institution) such that "covered transactions" with the Company may be affected
by the relationship to the detriment of the institution. "Control" is determined
to exist if a percentage stock ownership test is met or if there is control over
the election of directors or the management or policies of the Company or
institution. "Covered transactions" generally include loans or extensions of
credit to an affiliate, purchases of securities issued by an affiliate,
purchases of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or
regulation), and certain other transactions. The OTS regulations and Sections
23A and 23B require that covered transactions and certain other transactions
with affiliates be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound
banking practices or on terms comparable to similar transactions with
non-affiliated parties, and imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of
and collateralization requirements on covered transactions. In addition, a
savings institution is prohibited from extending credit to an affiliate (other
than a subsidiary of the institution), unless the affiliate is engaged only in
activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined, by regulation, to be
permissible for bank holding companies. Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal
Reserve Act impose limitations on loans and extensions of credit from an
institution to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and
each of their related interests.

     ACTIVITIES LIMITATIONS. A unitary savings and loan holding company, such as
the Company, whose sole insured institution subsidiary qualifies as a QTL
(described below) generally has the broadest authority to engage in various
types of business activities. A holding company that acquires another
institution and maintains it as a separate subsidiary or whose sole subsidiary
fails to meet the QTL test will become subject to the activities limitations
applicable to multiple savings and loan holding companies.

SAVINGS INSTITUTION REGULATIONS

     Federal savings institutions such as the Bank are chartered by the OTS, are
members of the FHLB system, and have their deposits insured by the SAIF. They
are subject to comprehensive OTS and FDIC regulations that are intended
primarily to protect depositors. SAIF-insured, federally chartered institutions
may not enter into certain transactions unless applicable regulatory tests are
met or they obtain necessary approvals. They are also required to file reports
with the OTS describing their activities and financial condition, and periodic
examinations by the OTS test compliance by institutions with various regulatory
requirements, some of which are described below.

     INSURANCE OF ACCOUNTS. The Bank's deposits are insured by the SAIF up to
$100,000 for each insured account holder, the maximum amount currently permitted
by law. Under the FDIC regulations implementing risk-based insurance premiums,
institutions are divided into three groups-well capitalized, adequately
capitalized and undercapitalized-based on criteria consistent with those
established pursuant to the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDICIA.
See "--Prompt Corrective Action"


                                       21
<PAGE>

below. Each of these groups is further divided into three subgroups, based on a
subjective evaluation of supervisory risk to the insurance fund posed by the
institution.

     As an insurer, the FDIC issues regulations and conducts examinations of its
insured members. SAIF insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC, after
notice and hearing, upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and
unsound practices, cannot continue operations because it is in an unsafe and
unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order
or condition imposed by the OTS or FDIC. When conditions warrant, the FDIC may
impose less severe sanctions as an alternative to termination of insurance. The
Bank's management does not know of any present condition pursuant to which the
FDIC would seek to impose sanctions on the Bank or terminate insurance of its
deposits.

     The FDIC's deposit insurance premiums are assessed through a risk-based
system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of
nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their level of
capital and supervisory evaluation. Under the system, institutions classified as
well capitalized (i.e., a core capital ratio of at least 5%, a ratio of Tier I
or core capital to risk-weighted assets ("Tier I risk-based capital") of at
least 6% and a risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%) and considered healthy
pay the lowest premium while institutions that are less than adequately
capitalized (i.e., core or Tier I risk-based capital ratios of less than 4% or a
risk-based capital ratio of less than 8%) and considered of substantial
supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured
institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.

     The FDIC is authorized to increase assessment rates, on a semiannual basis,
if it determines that the reserve ratio of the SAIF will be less than the
designated reserve ratio of 1.25% of SAIF insured deposits. In setting these
increased assessments, the FDIC must seek to restore the reserve ratio to that
designated reserve level, or such higher reserve ratio as is established by the
FDIC. The FDIC may also impose special assessments on SAIF members to repay
amounts borrowed from the United States Treasury or for any other reason deemed
necessary by the FDIC.

     In September 1996, Congress enacted legislation to eliminate this
disparity, and any competitive disadvantage between BIF and SAIF member
institutions, from SAIF deposit insurance premiums, which were generally higher
that BIF deposit insurance premiums. The legislation provided for a one-time
assessment to be imposed on all deposits assessed at the SAIF rates, as of March
31, 1995, in order to recapitalize the SAIF. It also provided for the merger of
the BIF and the SAIF on January 1, 1999 if no savings associations then exist.
The special assessment rate was established at .657% of deposits by the FDIC and
the resulting assessment of $2.6 million (exclusive of an additional $2.3
million payment which relates to Suncoast deposits) was paid in November 1996.
This special assessment significantly increased non-interest expense and
adversely affected the Bank's results of operations for the year ended September
30, 1996. As a result of the special assessment, the Bank's deposit insurance
premiums were initially reduced to 6.7 basis points, and as of September 30,
1998 to 6.2 basis points based upon its current risk classification and the new
assessment schedule for SAIF insured institutions. These premiums are subject to
change in future periods.

     Prior to the enactment of the legislation, a portion of the SAIF assessment
imposed on savings associations was used to repay obligations issued by a
federally chartered corporation to provide financing ("FICO") for resolving the
thrift crisis in the 1980's. Although the FDIC has proposed that the SAIF
assessment be equalized with the BIF assessment schedule, SAIF-insured
institutions will continue to be subject to a FICO assessment as a result of
this continuing obligation. Although the legislation also now requires
assessments to be made on BIF-assessable deposits for this purpose, that
assessment will be limited to 20% of the rate imposed on SAIF assessable
deposits until the earlier of December 31, 1999 or when no savings association
continues to exist, thereby imposing a greater burden on SAIF member
institutions such as the Bank. Thereafter, however, assessments on BIF-member
institutions will be made on the same basis as SAIF-member institutions. The
rates to be established by the FDIC to implement this requirement for all
FDIC-insured institutions were 6.48 basis points assessment on SAIF deposits and
1.30 basis points on BIF deposits until BIF insured institutions participate
fully in the assessment.

     REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. As mandated by the FIRREA, the OTS adopted
capital standards under which savings institutions must currently maintain (i) a
tangible capital requirement of 1.5% of adjusted total assets, (ii) a leverage
(or core capital) ratio of 3.0% of adjusted total assets, and (iii) a risk-based
capital requirement of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets. These requirements (which
cannot be less stringent than those applicable to national banks) apply to the
Bank. Under current law and regulations, there are no capital requirements
directly applicable to the Company. See also -"Changes to Capital Requirements"
below.

     Under the current OTS regulations, "tangible capital" includes common
shareholders' equity (including retained earnings), noncumulative perpetual
preferred stock and related earnings, certain qualifying nonwithdrawable
accounts and pledged deposits, and minority interests in fully consolidated
subsidiaries, less intangible assets (except certain servicing assets) and
specified portions of debt and equity investments in certain subsidiaries. "Core
capital" is tangible capital plus limited amounts of intangible assets meeting
marketability criteria. The "risk-based capital" requirement provides that an
institution's total capital must equal


                                       22
<PAGE>


8% of risk-weighted assets. Certain institutions will be required to deduct an
interest rate risk component from their total capital, as described below.
"Total capital" equals core capital plus "supplementary capital" (which includes
specified amounts of cumulative preferred stock, certain limited-life preferred
stock, subordinated debt and other capital instruments) in an amount equal to
not more than 100% of core capital. "Risk-weighted assets" are determined by
assigning designated risk weights based on the credit risk associated with the
particular asset. As provided by OTS regulations, representative risk weights
include: 0% for cash and assets that are backed by the full faith and credit of
the United States; 20% for cash items in the process of collection, FHLB stock,
agency securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
and certain high-quality mortgage-related securities; 50% for certain revenue
bonds, qualifying mortgage loans, certain non-high-quality mortgage-related
securities and certain qualifying residential construction loans; and 100% for
consumer, commercial and other loans, repossessed assets, assets that are 90 or
more days past due, and all other assets.

     As of September 30, 1998, the Bank's tangible, core and risk-based capital
ratios were 8.7%, 8.7% and 17.5% respectively.

     The OTS regulatory capital regulations take into account a savings
institution's exposure to the risk of loss from changing interest rates. Under
the regulations, a savings institution with an above normal level of interest
rate risk exposure will be required to deduct an IRR component from its total
capital when determining its compliance with the risk-based capital
requirements. An "above normal" level of interest rate risk exposure is a
projected decline of 2% in the net present value of an institution's assets and
liabilities resulting from a 2% swing in interest rates. The IRR component will
equal one-half of the difference between the institution's measured interest
rate exposure and the "normal" (i,e. 2%) level of exposure. Savings institutions
are required to file data with the OTS that the OTS will use to calculate, on a
quarterly basis, the institutions' measured interest rate risk and IRR
components. The IRR component to be deducted from capital is the lowest of the
IRR components for the preceding three quarters. The OTS may waive or defer an
institution's IRR component on a case-by-case basis. Implementation of the IRR
requirements have been delayed. As of September 30, 1998, the Company would not
have been required to deduct an IRR component from its total capital when
determining its compliance with the Bank's risk-based capital.

     If an institution becomes categorized as "undercapitalized" under the
definitions established by the "prompt corrective action" provisions of the
FDICIA, it will become subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDICIA.
See "Prompt Corrective Action" below.

     PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION. The OTS and other federal banking regulators have
established capital levels for institutions to implement the "prompt corrective
action" provisions of the FDICIA. Based on these capital levels, insured
institutions will be categorized as well capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.
The FDICIA requires federal banking regulators, including the OTS, to take
prompt corrective action to solve the problems of those institutions that fail
to satisfy their applicable minimum capital requirements. The level of
regulatory scrutiny and restrictions imposed become increasingly severe as an
institution's capital level falls.

     A "well capitalized" institution must have total risk-based capital of 10%
or more, core capital of 5% or more and Tier I risk-based capital (based on the
ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets) of 6% or more and may not be
subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective
action directive issued by the OTS. The Bank is a well capitalized institution
under the definitions as adopted. An institution will be categorized as
"adequately capitalized" if it has total risk-based capital of 8% or more, Tier
1 risk-based capital of 4% or more, and either core capital of 4% or more or
core capital 3% or more and a CAMEL composite rating of 1; "undercapitalized" if
it has total risk-based capital of less than 8%, Tier I risk-based capital of
less than 4%, or either core capital of less than 4% or core capital of less
than 3% and a CAMEL rating of 1; "significantly undercapitalized" if it has
total risk-based capital of less than 6%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of less than
3%, or core capital of less than 3%; and "critically undercapitalized" if it has
a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to less than 2%.

     In the case of an institution that is categorized as "undercapitalized," or
worse, such an institution must submit a capital restoration plan to the OTS. An
undercapitalized depository institution generally will not be able to acquire
other banks or thrifts, establish additional branches, pay dividends, or engage
in any new lines of business unless consistent with its capital plan. A
"significantly undercapitalized" institution will be subject to additional
restrictions on its affiliate transactions, the interest rates paid by the
institution on its deposits, the institution's asset growth, compensation of
senior executive officers, and activities deemed to pose excessive risk to the
institution. Regulators may also order a significantly undercapitalized
institution to hold elections for new directors, terminate any director or
senior executive officer employed for more than 180 days prior to the time the
institution became significantly undercapitalized, or hire qualified senior
executive officers approved by the regulators.

     The FDICIA provides that an institution that is "critically
undercapitalized" must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90
days of becoming categorized as such unless the institution's regulator and the
FDIC jointly determine that some other course of action would result in a lower
resolution cost to the institution's insurance fund. Thereafter, the
institution's regulator must periodically reassess its determination to permit a
particular critically undercapitalized institution to continue to operate. A
conservator or receiver must be appointed for the institution at the end of an
approximately one-year period following the


                                       23
<PAGE>


institution's initial classification as critically undercapitalized unless a
number of stringent conditions are met, including a determination by the
regulator and the FDIC that the institution has positive net worth and a
certification by such agencies that the institution is viable and not expected
to fail.

     The final rules establishing the capital levels for purposes of the FDICIA
also indicate that the federal regulators intend to lower or eliminate the core
capital requirement from the definitions of well capitalized, adequately
capitalized and undercapitalized after the requirement to deduct an IRR
component from total capital becomes effective. This action has not yet been
taken. See "Regulatory Capital Requirements" above.

     In addition to the foregoing prompt corrective action provisions, the
FDICIA also sets forth requirements that the federal banking agencies, including
the OTS, review their capital standards every two years to ensure that their
standards require sufficient capital to facilitate prompt corrective action and
to minimize loss to the SAIF and the BIF.

     RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS AND OTHER CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS. The current OTS
regulation applicable to the payment of dividends or other capital distributions
by savings institutions imposes limits on capital distributions based on an
institution's regulatory capital levels and net income. An institution that
meets or exceeds all of its capital requirements (both before and after giving
effect to the distribution) and is not in need of more than normal supervision
would be a "Tier 1 association." A Tier I association may make capital
distributions during a calendar year of up to the greater of (i) 100% of net
income for the current calendar year plus 50% of its capital surplus or (ii) the
amount permitted for a "Tier 2 association" which is 75% of its net income over
the most recent four quarters. Any additional capital distributions would
require notice and opportunity for objection or prior regulatory approval. The
Bank currently exceeds its fully phased-in capital requirements and qualifies as
a Tier I association under the regulation. A "Tier 3 association" is defined as
an institution that does not meet all of the minimum regulatory capital
requirements and therefore may not make any capital distributions without the
prior approval of the OTS.

     Savings institutions must provide the OTS with at least 30 days written
notice before making any capital distributions. All such capital distributions
are also subject to the OTS' right to object to a distribution on safety and
soundness grounds.

     The OTS has proposed regulations that would revise the current capital
distribution restrictions to conform to the rules of the other banking agencies.
The proposed rule would require a savings association to file an application
with the OTS prior to making any capital distribution, if the total amount of
the association's capital distributions, including the proposed distribution,
for the applicable calendar year exceeds the associations net income for that
year to date plus the association's net income for the preceding two years or if
the association is not eligible for expedited treatment. A notice would be
required if an application is not required, but the savings association would
not be at least adequately capitalized after the distribution, the proposed
distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of the associations
common or preferred stock or any part of debt instruments such as notes or
debentures included in capital (other than regular debt payments on approved
debt instruments), the proposed distribution would violate any applicable
statute, regulation or agreement between the association and the OTS, or the
association is a holding company subsidiary. In all other circumstances not
listed herein, no notice or application would be required. A savings association
would qualify for expedited treatment if it has a CAMEL rating of 1 or 2, has a
CRA rating of satisfactory or better, has a compliance rating of 1 or 2, is
meeting all of its capital requirements, and is not of supervisory concern. The
OTS may disapprove a notice or deny an application if the association would be
undercapitalized after the distribution, if the OTS determines that the
distribution raises safety or soundness concerns, or if the distribution
violates any applicable statute, regulation or agreement between the OTS and the
association.

     QUALIFIED THRIFT LENDER TEST. Pursuant to amendments effected by the
FDICIA, a savings institution will be a QTL if its qualified thrift investments
equal or exceed 65% of its portfolio assets on a monthly average basis in nine
of every 12 months. Qualified thrift investments, under the revised QTL test,
include (i) certain housing-related loans and investments, (ii) certain
obligations of the FSLIC, the FDIC, the FSLIC Resolution Fund and the RTC, (iii)
loans to purchase or construct churches, schools, nursing homes and hospitals
(subject to certain limitations), (iv) consumer loans (subject to certain
limitations), (v) shares of stock issued by any FHLB, and (vi) shares of stock
issued by the FHLMC or the FNMA (subject to certain limitations). Portfolio
assets under the revised test consist of total assets minus (a) goodwill and
other intangible assets, (b) the value of properties used by the savings
institution to conduct its business, and (c) certain liquid assets in an amount
not exceeding 20% of total assets.

     Any savings institution that fails to become or remain a QTL must either
convert to a national bank charter or be subject to restrictions specified in
the OTS regulations. Any such savings institution that does not become a bank
will be: (i) prohibited from making any new investment or engaging in activities
that would not be permissible for national banks; (ii) prohibited from
establishing any new branch office in a location that would not be permissible
for a national bank in the institution's home state; (iii) ineligible to obtain
new advances from any FHLB; and (iv) subject to limitations on the payment of
dividends comparable to the statutory and regulatory dividend restrictions
applicable to national banks. Also, beginning three years after the date on
which the savings association ceases to be a QTL, the savings association would
be prohibited from retaining any investment


                                       24
<PAGE>

or engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank and would be
required to repay any outstanding advances to any FHLB. A savings institution
may requalify as a QTL if it thereafter complies with the QTL test. At September
30, 1998, the Bank exceeded the QTL requirements.

     FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system,
which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks governed and regulated by
the Federal Housing Finance Board. The Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central
credit facility for member institutions, The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of
Atlanta, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of
Atlanta in an amount at least equal to the greater of 1% of the aggregate
principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase
contracts and similar obligations as of the close of each calendar year, or 5%
of its borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta (including advances and letters of
credit issued by the FHLB on the Bank's behalf). The Bank is currently in
compliance with this requirement, with a $51.3 million investment in stock of
the FHLB of Atlanta as of September 30, 1998.

     The FHLB of Atlanta makes advances to members in accordance with policies
and procedures periodically established by the Federal Housing Finance Board and
the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Atlanta. Currently outstanding advances
from the FHLB of Atlanta are required to be secured by a member's shares of
stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and by certain types of mortgages and other assets.
The FIRREA further limited the eligible collateral in certain respects. Interest
rates charged for advances vary depending on maturity, the cost of funds to the
FHLB of Atlanta and the purpose of the borrowing. As of September 30, 1998,
advances from the FHLB of Atlanta totaled $1.0 billion. The FIRREA restricted
the amount of FHLB advances that a member institution may obtain, and in some
circumstances requires repayment of outstanding advances, if the institution
does not meet the QTL test. See "--Qualified Thrift Lender Test," above.

     LIQUIDITY. OTS regulations currently require member savings institutions to
maintain for each calendar month an average daily balance of liquid assets (cash
and certain time deposits, securities of certain mutual funds, bankers'
acceptances, corporate debt securities and commercial paper, and specified U.S.
government, state government and federal agency obligations) equal to at least
4% of its average daily balance during the preceding calendar month of net
withdrawable deposits and short-term borrowings (generally borrowings having
maturities of one year or less). The Director of the OTS may vary this liquidity
requirement from time to time within a range of 4% to 10%. Monetary penalties
may be imposed for failure to meet liquidity requirements. For the month of
September 1998, the Bank's liquidity ratio was 7.18%. The Bank is also required
to maintain cash reserve requirements at the Federal Home Loan Bank. At
September 30, 1998 this cash reserve requirement was $8.2 million.

     COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the
"CRA"), as implemented by the OTS regulations, a savings institution has a
continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound
operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low
and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending
requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an
institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it
believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA.
The CRA requires the OTS, in connection with its examination of a financial
institution, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of
its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain
applications. The FIRREA amended the CRA to require public disclosure of an
institution's CRA rating and to require that the OTS provide a written
evaluation of an institution's CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered
descriptive rating system in lieu of the existing five-tiered numerical rating
system. Based upon an OTS examination in fiscal 1997, the Bank's CRA rating is
satisfactory.

     Effective July 1, 1995, the OTS together with the other federal banking
agencies, adopted a joint rule amending each of their regulations concerning the
CRA. Subject to certain exceptions and elections, the new regulations prescribe
three tests for the evaluation of a savings institution's performance. The
lending test evaluates a savings institution's record of helping to meet the
credit needs of its assessment area through its lending activities by
considering an institution's home mortgage, small business, small farm, and
community development lending. The investment test evaluates a savings
institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area
through qualified investments that benefit its assessment area or a broader
statewide or regional area including the assessment area. Finally, the service
test evaluates a savings institution by analyzing both the availability and the
effectiveness of the institution's systems for delivering retail banking
services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development
services. Based upon the savings institution's performance under the lending,
investment and service tests, and any other tests which may be applicable to the
institution under the new regulations, the OTS will assign the savings
institution one of the same four ratings prescribed under current regulations.
Additionally, under the new regulations, the OTS will continue to consider an
institution's record of performance under the CRA in the same manner and for the
same purposes as required under current regulations.

     These new regulations, while effective July 1, 1995, were implemented over
a two-year time frame. A savings institution may elect to be evaluated under the
revised performance tests beginning January 1, 1996, although the Company has
not made


                                       25
<PAGE>

such election. Absent such an election, these revised performance tests became
mandatory and were deemed to replace the regulations described above effective
July 1, 1997.

     LOANS-TO-ONE-BORROWER LIMITATIONS. The FIRREA provided that loans-to-one
borrower limits applicable to national banks apply to savings institutions.
Generally, under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at
one time to a single borrower shall not exceed 15% of the savings institution's
unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of credit fully
secured by certain readily marketable collateral may represent an additional 10%
of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. As of September 30, 1998, the Bank
was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.

PORTFOLIO POLICY GUIDELINES

     The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a Supervisory
Policy Statement on Securities Activities (the "Policy"), which provides
guidance to an institution in developing its portfolio policy, specifies factors
that must be considered when evaluating an institution's investment portfolio,
and provides guidance on the suitability of acquiring and holding certain
products, such as mortgage derivative products, in its investment portfolio. The
Policy, among other things, defines "high-risk mortgage securities" and provides
that such securities are not suitable investment portfolio holdings for
depository institutions and that they may only be acquired to reduce interest
rate risk. The determination of a high-risk mortgage security will be based upon
a quantitative calculation of the average life of the security, and the change
in the average life and market price sensitivity of the security based on a
300-basis-point shift in the yield curve. Currently, the Bank does not hold any
high-risk mortgage securities. The Policy, however, is applicable to all
depository institutions and will affect the Bank's ability to invest in certain
mortgage securities, primarily collateralized mortgage obligations, in the
future.

GENERAL LENDING REGULATIONS

     The Bank's lending activities are subject to federal and state regulation,
including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the laws of
Florida, California and other jurisdictions governing discrimination, lender
disclosure to borrowers, foreclosure procedures and anti-deficiency judgments,
among other matters.

FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

     The Bank is subject to certain regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board. Pursuant to such regulations, savings institutions are required
to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily
interest-bearing checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. The balances
maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve Board
may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the OTS. In addition,
Federal Reserve Board regulations limit the periods within which depository
institutions must provide availability for and pay interest on deposits to
transaction accounts. Depository institutions are required to disclose their
check-hold policies and any changes to those policies in writing to customers.
The Bank is in compliance with all such Federal Reserve Board regulations.

TAXATION

     The Company reports its income and expenses under an accrual method of
accounting and prior to 1994 filed federal income tax returns on a calendar year
basis. Beginning in 1994 and continuing thereafter, the Company and its
subsidiaries have elected to file consolidated tax returns on a fiscal year
basis ended September 30. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the "1986 Act"), which was
signed into law on October 22, 1986, revised the income tax laws applicable to
corporations in general and to savings institutions, such as the Bank, in
particular. Except as specifically noted, the discussion below relates to
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.

     The Company has not been notified of a proposed examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS") of its federal income tax returns.

BAD DEBT RESERVES

     DEDUCTIONS. Prior to legislation enacted in August 1996, the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code") permitted savings institutions, such as the Bank, to
establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions thereto, which
additions may, within specified formula limits, be deducted in determining
taxable income. The bad debt reserve deduction was generally based upon a
savings institution's actual loss experience (the "experience method"). In
addition, provided that certain definitional tests relating to the composition
of assets and sources of income are met, a savings institution was permitted to
elect annually to compute the allowable addition to its bad debt reserve for
losses on qualifying real property loans (generally loans secured by improved
real estate) by reference to a percentage of its taxable income (the "percentage
of taxable income method").


                                       26
<PAGE>

     Under the percentage of taxable income method, a savings institution was
permitted, in general, to claim a deduction for additions to bad debt reserves
equal to 8% of the savings institution's taxable income. Taxable income for this
purpose is defined as taxable income before the bad debt deduction, but without
regard to any deduction allowable for any addition to the reserve for bad debt.
Certain adjustments must also be made for gains on the sale of corporate stock
and tax exempt obligations. For this purpose, the taxable income of a savings
institution for a taxable year is calculated after utilization of net operating
loss carry forwards.

     In August of 1996, legislation was enacted that repealed the reserve method
of accounting (including the percentage of taxable income method) used by many
thrifts, including the Bank, to calculate their bad debt deduction for federal
income tax purposes. The legislation requires thrifts to account for bad debts
for federal income tax purposes on the same basis as commercial banks for tax
years beginning after December 31, 1995. As such, thrifts with assets whose tax
basis exceeds $500,000,000 must change to the specific charge off method in
computing its bad debt deduction. As such, the Bank must use the specific charge
off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax years beginning after
December 31, 1995.

     As a result of this change in accounting method, the Bank must recapture
the excess of its September 30, 1996 bad debt reserve over the reserve in
existence on December 31, 1987. This recapture will occur over a six-year
period, the commencement of which will be delayed until the first taxable year
beginning after December 31, 1997, provided the institution meets certain
residential lending requirements. The management of the Company does not believe
that the legislation will have a material impact on the Company or the Bank.

     DISTRIBUTIONS. Under the Code, the Bank's December 31, 1987 reserve must be
recaptured into taxable income as a result of certain non-dividend
distributions. A distribution is a non-dividend distribution to the extent that,
for federal income tax purposes, (i) it is in redemption of shares, (ii) it is
pursuant to a liquidation of the institution, or (iii) in the case of a current
distribution it, together with all other such distributions during the taxable
year, exceeds the Bank's current and post-1951 accumulated earnings and profits.
The amount charged against the Bank's bad debt reserves in respect of a
distribution will be includable in its gross income and will equal the amount of
such distribution, increased by the amount of federal income tax resulting from
such inclusion.

ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX

     In addition to the income tax, corporations are generally subject to an
alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20%. The alternative minimum tax is imposed
on the sum of regular taxable income (with certain adjustments) and tax
preference items, less any available exemption ("AMTI"). The alternative minimum
tax is imposed to the extent that it exceeds a corporation's regular income tax
liability. The items of tax preference that constitute AMTI for 1990 and
thereafter include 75% of the difference between the taxpayer's adjusted current
earnings and AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to any
deduction for net operating loss carry forwards or carry backs). In addition,
net operating loss carry forwards cannot offset more than 90% of AMTI.

INTEREST ALLOCABLE TO TAX-EXEMPT OBLIGATIONS

     The 1986 Act eliminates for financial institutions the deduction for
interest expense allocable to the purchase or carrying of most tax-exempt
obligations for taxable years ending after December 31, 1986, with respect to
tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 excluding certain financial
institution-qualified issues. For all qualified issues and for non-qualified
tax-exempt obligations acquired after 1982 and before August 7, 1986, 20% of
allocable interest expense deductions will be disallowed.

STATE TAXATION

     The State of Florida imposes a corporate income tax on the Company, at a
rate of 5.5% of the Company's taxable income as determined for Florida income
tax purposes. Taxable income for this purpose is based on federal taxable income
with certain adjustments. A credit against the tax, for Florida intangible taxes
paid, is allowable in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of such
intangible taxes paid or (ii) 65% of the tax liability.

FORECLOSURES

     Tax legislation enacted in August of 1996 significantly changed the tax
treatment with respect to foreclosures for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 1995. Prior to this legislation, a thrift's acquisition of property
by means of foreclosure was not treated as a taxable event for federal tax
purposes. As such no gain or loss was recognized at the time of foreclosure and
no portion of the debt could be treated as worthless. In addition, prior to the
August 1996 legislation, thrift institutions were allowed a tax benefit for
write downs of foreclosed property to fair market value. Finally, for thrifts
that computed its bad debt deduction


                                       27
<PAGE>

under the experience method, gains or losses realized from the sale of
foreclosed property were not taken into account in computing taxable income, but
were credited or charged to the thrift's bad debt reserve.

     As a result of the newly enacted tax legislation, thrift foreclosures are
treated as a taxable event for federal tax purposes for property acquired after
December 31, 1995. As such, a thrift may recognize gain, loss or a bad debt
deduction at the time of foreclosure depending on the method by which the
property was acquired. In addition, write downs of foreclosed property to fair
market value no longer give rise to a tax benefit. Finally, gains and losses
realized upon the sale of foreclosed property are included in taxable income of
the thrift.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are involved as
plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of
their businesses. While the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that no proceedings
exist, either individually or in the aggregate, which, if determined adversely
to the Company and its subsidiaries, would have a material effect on the
Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

     No matters were submitted to a vote of the Company's security holders
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

     BankUnited Financial Corporation (the "Company" or "BankUnited") is a
Florida-incorporated savings and loan holding company that operates as a
financial intermediary by acquiring and investing funds primarily through its
principal subsidiary, BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"). The Bank is subject to the
regulations of certain federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by
those regulatory authorities. References to the Company include the activities
of all of its subsidiaries, including the Bank and its subsidiaries, if the
context so requires.

     The following discussion and analysis and the related financial data
present a review of the consolidated operating results and financial condition
of the Company for the fiscal years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996.
This discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding
and evaluating the financial condition, results of operations and future
prospects of BankUnited, and is intended to supplement, and should be read in
conjunction with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

     BankUnited's income is derived primarily from its loans and other
investments. Funding for such loans and investments is derived principally from
deposits, loan repayments, and borrowings. Consequently, BankUnited's net income
depends, to a large extent, on the interest rate spread between the average
yield earned on loans and investments and the average rate paid on deposits and
borrowings. Results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and
asset quality of BankUnited's loans and investments.

     In addition to the foregoing, results of BankUnited's operations, like
those of other financial institution holding companies, are affected by
BankUnited's asset and liability management policies, as well as factors beyond
BankUnited's control, such as general economic conditions and the monetary and
fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are affected by
the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans, which is in turn
affected by the interest rates at which such financings may be offered and other
factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds. Deposit
flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing
investments and by general market rates of interest.

ACQUISITIONS

     The Company has had an active acquisition program during the last two years
and expects to continue this program in the foreseeable future.

     On June 19, 1998, the Company acquired Central Bank ("Central"), for
1,386,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, and merged Central,
which had assets of $93.9 million and deposits of $65.9 million as of June 19,
1998, into the Bank.

     On January 23, 1998, the Company acquired Consumers Bancorp, Inc.
("Consumers"), for approximately $12.0 million in a combination of cash and
stock, and merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Consumers Savings Bank, which had
assets of $104.4 million and deposits of $88.3 million as of January 23, 1998,
into the Bank.

     On November 15, 1996, BankUnited completed its acquisition of Suncoast
Savings and Loan Association, FSA ("Suncoast"). Suncoast had total assets of
$409.4 million, net loans of $335.0 million, deposits of $298.5 million and
shareholders' equity of $24.7 million as of September 30, 1996. The cost of the
acquisition to BankUnited was $27.8 million, representing the fair value of
consideration given to Suncoast shareholders as well as option and warrant
holders.

     See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information regarding these acquisitions.

DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION CHANGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,
1998, 1997, AND 1996

     Total assets increased $1.6 billion, or 76.2% to $3.7 billion at September
30, 1998 from $2.1 billion at September 30, 1997, as compared to $824 million at
September 30, 1996.

     LOANS. The Company's net loans receivable increased by $1.2 billion, or
70.6% to $2.9 billion at September 30, 1998 from $1.7 billion at September 30,
1997. The increase was primarily the result of the $2.7 billion of residential
loans purchased, $386.0 million of loans originated, and $66.3 million and $44.2
million of loans acquired with Consumers and Central, respectively, partially
offset by repayments of $1.4 billion (net of accretion of discount and
amortization of premium) and the securitization of $355.5 million of mortgage
loans.

     In fiscal 1997, the Company's net loans receivable increased by $1.1
billion, or 170.2% to $1.7 billion at September 30, 1997 from $646 million at
September 30, 1996. The increase was primarily the result of the $913.7 million
of residential loans purchased in fiscal 1997, $341.4 million of loans acquired
with Suncoast, and $178.3 million of loan originations, partially offset by
principal repayments of $271 million (net of accretion of discount and
amortization of premium).

     Of the new loans originated or purchased during fiscal 1998 totaling $3.1
billion, $2.0 billion or 64.5% represented adjustable-rate residential loans
("ARMs"). Of BankUnited's total net loans receivable of $2.9 billion at
September 30, 1998, $1.6 billion or 55.2% were ARMs. Of this amount BankUnited
had $98.1 million in ARMs tied to the 11th District Federal Home Loan Bank cost
of funds index ("COFI"). COFI is a lagging index in that it does not change as
quickly as market rates.

     Loans available for sale as of September 30, 1998, were $172.4 million as
compared to $104.3 million at September 30, 1997 and no such loans were
available for sale as of September 30, 1996. Beginning in the Company's fiscal
1997 fourth quarter,

                                       36
<PAGE>


management began a program to sell substantially all of the Company's internally
generated residential loans. These loans are classified as held for sale when
originated and if, after attempting to market the loans, management determines
that certain loans are unable to be packaged into saleable pools, the Company
may transfer such loans to its portfolio at the lower of cost or market. During
the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998 and the fiscal 1997 fourth quarter,
residential loans totaling $173.5 million and $30.1 million, respectively, were
sold for a gain of $4.0 million and $523,000, respectively. In addition, as part
of starting this program, the Company reclassified $93.5 million of its
internally generated portfolio of residential loans as available for sale in the
fiscal 1997 fourth quarter. Currently, the Company classifies loans as available
for sale at time of origination.

     CREDIT QUALITY. At September 30, 1998, non-performing assets totaled $22.6
million as compared to $14.3 million and $7.8 million at September 30, 1997 and
1996, respectively. Expressed as a percentage of total assets, non-performing
assets declined to 0.61% as of September 30, 1998 as compared to 0.67% as of
September 30, 1997 and 0.95% as of September 30, 1996. The increase in
non-performing assets in 1998 is due primarily to the increase in total loans.

     The allowance for loan losses was $6.1 million, $3.7 million, and $2.2
million at September 30, 1998, 1997, and 1996, respectively. The allowance for
loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.20% at fiscal year end
1998, as compared to 0.21% at fiscal year end 1997, and 0.34% at fiscal year end
1996. The decrease in the allowance as a percentage of total loans reflects the
Company's recent charge-off history which shows net charge-offs (recoveries) as
a percentage of average loans of 0.02%, 0.04% and (0.12%) for 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively. The increase in non-performing assets to $22.6 million as of
September 30, 1998 from $14.3 million as of September 30, 1997 was due to
increases in non-performing loans of $6.7 million which, as stated above,
relates to the increase in total loans. Real estate owned increased to $2.0
million as of September 30, 1998 from $611,000 as of September 30, 1997.

     Effective October 1, 1995, BankUnited adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" as amended by SFAS No. 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosures" (collectively, "SFAS No. 114").
There was no impact on the consolidated statement of operations upon
implementation due to the composition of BankUnited's loan portfolio (primarily
residential or collateral dependent loans) and BankUnited's policy for
establishing the allowance for loan losses. The only impact to the consolidated
statement of financial condition and to non-performing assets was to reclassify
three loans totaling $522,000 previously classified as in-substance foreclosures
in real estate owned to non-accrual loans. These loans were reclassified because
BankUnited did not have possession of the collateral which, under SFAS No. 114,
is required for a loan to be classified as real estate owned. SFAS No. 114 does
not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are
collectively evaluated for impairment. Loans collectively reviewed by BankUnited
for impairment include all residential and consumer loans that are past due not
more than 60 days. All other loans are reviewed based on specific criteria such
as delinquency or other factors that may come to the attention of management.
BankUnited's impaired loans within the scope of SFAS No. 114 include all
non-performing loans.

     BankUnited's process for evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loans
losses has three basic elements: first is the identification of impaired loans;
second is the establishment of an appropriate loan loss allowance once
individual specific impaired loans are identified; and third is a methodology
for establishing loan losses based on the inherent risk in the remainder of the
loan portfolio, past loan loss experience, specific loans which could have loss
potential, geographic and industry concentration, delinquency trends, economic
conditions, the views of its regulators, and other relevant factors.

     The identification of impaired loans is achieved mainly through individual
reviews of all loans 60 or more days past due. Loss allowances are established
for specifically identified impaired loans based on the fair value of the
underlying collateral in accordance with SFAS No. 114.

     Impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a
charge to the provision for loan losses. Adjustments to impairment losses
resulting from changes in the fair value of an impaired loan's collateral are
included in the provision for loan losses. Upon disposition of an impaired loan
any related valuation allowance is removed from the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is adjusted by additions charged to operations as
a provision for loan losses and by loan recoveries, with actual losses charged
as reductions to the allowance.

     Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate given
the strength of BankUnited's collateral position and the attention given to loan
review and classifications. There can be no assurance that additional provisions
for loan losses will not be required in future periods.

</TABLE>

(1)  Gross interest income that would have been recorded on non-accrual loans
     had they been current in accordance with original terms was $1,037,000,
     $556,000, $217,000, $128,000, and $52,000, for the years ended September
     30, 1998, 1997, 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively. The amount of interest
     income on such non-accrual loans included in net income for years ended
     September 30, 1998, 1997, and 1996 was $372,000, $369,000, and $145,000,
     respectively.
(2)  All restructured loans were accruing.
(3)  In addition to the above, management has concerns as to the borrower's
     ability to comply with present repayment terms on $2,679,000 and $1,878,000
     of accruing loans as of September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
     Management estimates the loss, if any, on these loans will not be
     significant.
(4)  Based on balances prior to deductions for allowance for loan losses.

     FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (FHLB) OVERNIGHT DEPOSITS. FHLB overnight deposits
decreased to $65.3 million at September 30, 1998 from $79.4 million at September
30, 1997, but increased from $28.3 million at September 30, 1996. This change is
due to adjustments to BankUnited's liquidity position in response to the growth
in the balance sheet and projected cash requirements.

     TAX CERTIFICATES. BankUnited's investment in tax certificates decreased
$9.3 million, or 18.9%, to $40.0 million at September 30, 1998 from $49.3
million at September 30, 1997 and $40.1 million at September 30, 1996. The
decrease was primarily the result of $27.7 million in certificate purchases
during fiscal 1998 which was offset by $37.0 million in certificate redemptions
and repayments.

     INVESTMENTS. Investments held to maturity remained constant at $14.5
million as of September 30, 1998 as compared with $14.5 million as of September
30, 1997 and increased from $11,000 as of September 30, 1996. Investments
available for sale increased $13.5 million to $23.7 million as of September 30,
1998 as compared to $10.2 million as of September 30, 1997 and $6.7 million as
of September 30, 1996. The increase is primarily due to the investment in agency
securities to be used as collateral for future borrowings.

     MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity
were $146.1 million, $11.4 million and $14.7 million at September 30, 1998, 1997
and 1996, respectively. The increase in fiscal 1998 was primarily due to the
securitization of $356.0 million of mortgage loans less repayments and
amortization of approximately $221.3 million.

     BankUnited's available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio
increased $90.7 million to $199.6 million as of September 30, 1998 from $108.9
million as of September 30, 1997, and $55.5 million as of September 30, 1996. In
fiscal 1998, the increase was due to $17.2 million and $13.2 million of
mortgage-backed securities acquired with Consumers and Central, respectively,
and purchases of $118.3 million, partially offset by sales of $15.0 million and
repayments and amortization of $44.8 million.

                                       38

<PAGE>


     OTHER INTEREST EARNING ASSETS. Other interest earning assets increased to
$51.3 million at September 30, 1998 from $33.6 million at September 30, 1997 and
$12.2 million as of September 30, 1996 . This category primarily represents
stock in the FHLB which the Company is required to purchase as FHLB advances
increase.

     OTHER ASSETS. Office properties and equipment, net, mortgage servicing
rights, goodwill and prepaid and other assets increased by $6.8 million, $4.1
million, $17.8 million and $20.9 million, respectively, from September 30, 1997
to September 30, 1998. These increases all relate primarily to the acquisition
of Consumers and Central. Accrued interest receivable increased $16.6 million
from September 30, 1997 to September 30, 1998, due to the increase in the loan
portfolio.

     Since acquiring Suncoast, the Company sold its $292 million Ginnie Mae
("GNMA") mortgage servicing portfolio for $4.7 million and transferred its
FDIC/RTC subservicing portfolio. No gain or loss was recorded on either of these
transactions.

     DEPOSITS. Deposits increased by $0.9 billion, or 75.0%, to $2.1 billion at
September 30, 1998 from $1.2 billion at September 30, 1997. Management believes
this increase is attributable to the Company's opening of additional branch
offices, the offering of competitive interest rates and personalized service in
a market area dominated by super-regional banks and continued industry
consolidation. The acquisition of Consumers and Central also contributed to this
increase with deposits of $88.3 million and $65.9 million, respectively.
BankUnited intends to open as many as 5 branches in the 1999 fiscal year.

     FHLB ADVANCES. FHLB advances were $1.0 billion at September 30, 1998, up
$0.3 billion from $0.7 billion at September 30, 1997. This increase was used to
fund, together with deposits and other sources, the purchase of residential
loans.

     TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES. In March 1998, BankUnited's subsidiary,
BankUnited Capital III, issued $102.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities; in
June 1997, BankUnited's subsidiary, BankUnited Capital II, issued $46 million of
Trust Preferred Securities; in December 1996, BankUnited's subsidiary,
BankUnited Capital, issued $50 million of Trust Preferred Securities; and in
March 1997, BankUnited Capital issued an additional $20 million of Trust
Preferred Securities. The net proceeds from the sales of the Trust Preferred
Securities were $98.9 million and $111.5 million for the years ended September
30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. These funds may be used for general corporate
purposes, including, but not limited to, acquisitions by either the Bank or the
Company, capital contributions to support the Bank's growth and for working
capital, and the possible repurchase of shares of the Company's preferred stock
subject to acceptable market conditions. In the year ended September 30, 1998,
BankUnited contributed $110.0 million of additional capital to the Bank.

     SUBORDINATED NOTES. On August 31, 1997, BankUnited called all outstanding
subordinated notes totaling $774,500.

     STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY. BankUnited's total stockholders' equity was $199.3
million at September 30, 1998, an increase of $99.7 million, or 100.1% from
$99.6 million at September 30, 1997. This was due primarily to the issuance of
3.7 million shares of Class A Common stock pursuant to a public stock offering
in October 1997 with net proceeds of approximately $43.9 million; the issuance
of 0.6 million shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the acquisition
of Consumers in January 1998 with an approximate value of $7.7 million; the
issuance of 1.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the
acquisition of Central in June 1998 with an approximate value of $22.8 million;
and the issuance of 1.08 million shares of Class A Common Stock, 30,000 shares
of Class B Common Stock and 25,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock in a
publicly underwritten offering and a direct offering to certain directors and
principal stockholders during April 1998 with net proceeds of $15.3 million.

     In September 1997, the Company exercised its right to call all the
outstanding shares of its 8% Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series
1996, effective October 10, 1997. As a result 927,204 shares converted to
1,548,410 shares of Class A Common Stock at a ratio of 1- 2/3 shares of common
stock for each share of preferred. The remaining 5,696 shares of preferred stock
were redeemed at $15 per share.

     In January 1998, the Company called the outstanding 743,870 shares of its
Series 1993 Preferred Stock effective February 20, 1998 at $10.00 per share.
Holders of shares of the Series 1993 Preferred Stock had the right to convert
them into shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock at a ratio of
one-for-one. Holders of 712,464 shares of Series 1993 Preferred Stock exercised
their conversion right, which resulted in the issuance of 712,464 additional
shares of Class A Common Stock, and 31, 406 shares of Series 1993 Preferred
Stock were redeemed.

     In June 1998, holders of 42,655 warrants issued by Suncoast exercised their
conversion right, which resulted in the issuance of 71,259 shares of Class A
Common Stock. The 5,545 warrants which remained unexercised after July 9, 1998
expired pursuant to the terms of the warrant agreements.

     In December 1998, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the 
purchase from time to time in open market transactions of up to 1,000,000 shares
of the Company's Class A Common Stock at such prices as the Executive Committee
shall deem advantageous.

     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. BankUnited's most significant sources of
funds are deposits, FHLB advances, amortization and pre-payment of mortgage
loans and securities, maturities of investment securities and other short term
investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations. While FHLB
advances, scheduled mortgage loan repayments and securities repayments are
relatively predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and prepayments on loans
and mortgage-backed securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates,
economic conditions and competition. BankUnited manages the pricing of its
deposits to maintain a desired balance. In addition, BankUnited invests excess
funds in federal funds and other short-term interest-earning assets which
provide liquidity to meet lending requirements.

     Over the last couple of years, the Company has increased the total deposit
base primarily through branch expansion in the South Florida market by 25% for
transaction accounts and 75% for certificates of deposit with contractual
maturities. While there

                                       39

<PAGE>



is no guarantee that the certificates of deposit will remain with the Company
upon maturity, the Company's branch network cultivates a strong customer base
which gives the Company reasonable assurance of available deposits at market
rates. Management expects the Company's market share to continue to grow.
Additional sources of funds are FHLB advances, which the Company generally uses
as a source of funds with longer maturities than deposits. FHLB advances are
limited to 30% of assets in accordance with the FHLB policy. As of September 30,
1998, the Company had 27% of FHLB advances to total assets. Other sources of
short-term funds are available through other collateral borrowings.

     During November 1998, the Company finalized a medium-term note program
which permits the issuance, from time to time, of up to $500 million of senior
notes with maturities from 9 months to 10 years from the date of issue. As a
condition of issuance, principal and interest on all offered notes will be
supported by an irrevocable stand-by letter of credit of the FHLB of Atlanta and
provide an additional source of funding, potentially with longer maturities with
attractive rates.

     The Bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain
specified levels of liquid investments in cash, United States government
securities and other qualifying investments. Regulations currently in effect
require the Bank to maintain liquid assets of not less than 4.0% of its net
withdrawable accounts plus short-term borrowings. As of September 30, 1998, the
Bank had liquid assets of 7.18% which was in compliance with this requirement,
and as of September 30, 1997, the Bank had liquid assets of 8.49%.

     BankUnited's primary use of funds is to purchase or originate loans and to
purchase mortgage-backed and investment securities. In fiscal 1998, 1997, and
1996, loans increased $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $193.0 million,
respectively, and BankUnited purchased $133.7 million, $78.6 million, and $22.7
million, respectively, of mortgage-backed and investment securities. Funding for
the above came primarily from increases in deposits of $928.9 million, $689.8
million and $196.1 million in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and increases
in FHLB advances and other borrowings of $543.6 million in 1998, $580.5 million
in 1997 and $52.7 million in 1996.

     Federal savings banks such as the Bank are also required to maintain
capital at levels specified by applicable minimum capital ratios. At September
30, 1998, the Bank was in compliance with all capital requirements and met the
definition of a "well capitalized" institution under applicable federal
regulations.

YEAR 2000

     The Company utilizes extensive electronic data processing hardware and
software in its banking operations, among other things, to process and record
customer transactions, determine and collect revenue to be earned and expenses
to be paid in connection with customer transactions, maintain and report
customer transaction information, record and manage the Company's short-term and
long-term investments, accounting and financial management, and risk management.
The Company also relies on certain vendors to provide critical services to the
Company's banking operations, including telecommunications, loan servicing and
correspondent banking. Failure of the electronic data processing hardware or
software of the Company, its third-party service bureaus, or certain vendors to
properly recognize the Year 2000 could result in a significant disruption of the
Company's banking operations.

     The Company's customer transactions are processed through a network of
electronic data processing workstations in its branch offices and loan servicing
department and are recorded on electronic data processing hardware and software,
a substantial portion of which are maintained by two third-party service
bureaus. The Company is in the process of replacing any hardware or software in
its branch offices to ensure compliance with Year 2000 issues, while one of the
Company's third-party service bureaus is working with the Company to convert its
customer transaction hardware and software to a more advanced version which is
expected to be completed in February 1999 and which will also be Year 2000
compliant. The third-party service bureau which processes the Company's loan
servicing transactions is also expected to be Year 2000 compliant. The Company
is in the process of replacing any other hardware and software used in its
operations as necessary for Year 2000 compliance. The Company is also seeking
Year 2000 compliance certifications from its major telecommunications, loan
servicing and correspondent banking vendors. While a portion of the Company's
financial assets and liabilities are with commercial businesses and government
sponsored entities, the Company's loans and deposits are primarily with
individuals. As a result, the Company does not expect any significant
disruptions resulting from customers that may not be Year 2000 compliant.

     While the Company does not anticipate any difficulties becoming Year 2000
compliant with its third-party service bureaus, the Company continues to monitor
the feasibility of using a substitute third-party service bureau in the event of
such difficulties. Following the February 1999 conversion, should any
operational problems arise regarding compliance with Year 2000, the Company will
immediately pursue an alternative plan. Management is unable at this time to
estimate the additional costs should such alternative plans become necessary.

     The Company has designated a Year 2000 task force under the direction of a
senior officer of the Company which is identifying and coordinating the
Company's efforts to become Year 2000 compliant. Additionally, the Company and
its banking subsidiary are subject to regulation and supervision by the OTS
which regularly conducts reviews of the safety and soundness of the Company's
operations, including the Company's progress in becoming Year 2000 compliant.
Failure by the Company to adequately prepare for Year 2000 issues could
negatively impact the Company's banking operations resulting in restrictions on
its banking operations by the OTS. No such restrictions exist at this time, nor
does the Company expect any such restrictions resulting from failure to address
Year 2000 issues.

     The Company has estimated the costs associated with becoming Year 2000
compliant to be approximately $679,000, of which, approximately $353,000 has
been expensed through September 30, 1998.

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1998
AND 1997

     NET INCOME AFTER PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. BankUnited had net income after
preferred stock dividends of $6.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1998,
compared to net income after preferred stock dividends of $4.7 million for the
year ended September 30, 1997. All major categories of income and expense
increased significantly in the year ended September 30, 1998 as compared to the
year ended September 30, 1997 and reflect the significant growth BankUnited has
experienced in the last year. Significant factors in such growth were the
acquisitions of Consumers and Central, which were completed on January 23, 1998
and June 19, 1998, respectively. BankUnited's Consolidated Statement of
Operations for the year ended September 30, 1998 reflects Consumers' and
Central's operations from the date of acquisition. Below is a more detailed
discussion of each major category of income and expenses.

     NET INTEREST INCOME. Net interest income increased $7.2 million, or 22.0%,
to $40.0 million for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $32.8 million for
the year ended September 30, 1997. This increase was attributable to an increase
in average interest-earning assets of $1.6 billion, or 114.3%, to $3.0 billion
for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $1.4 billion for the year ended
September 30,1997 partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin to
1.32% for the year ended September 30, 1998 from 2.31% for the year ended
September 30, 1997. The increase in average interest-earning assets was
primarily due to the purchase of $2.7 billion of residential mortgage loans
during the 1998 fiscal year. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to
a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets to 6.86% for the year ended
September 30, 1998 from 7.65% for the year ended September 30, 1997, primarily
attributable to the lower yields on the loans purchased, and a 17 basis point
increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 5.75% for the year ended
September 30, 1998 from 5.58% for the year ended September 30, 1997.

     The increase in interest income of $98.8 million, or 90.8%, to $207.6
million for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $108.8 million for the year
ended September 30, 1997, primarily reflects increases in interest and fees on
loans of $82.6 million and a $9.6 million increase in interest on
mortgage-backed securities. This increase in interest and fees on loans is due
to an increase in average loans outstanding of $1.3 billion, or 108.3%, to $2.5
billion for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $1.2 billion for the year
ended September 30, 1997 which resulted primarily from purchases of residential
loans in the secondary mortgage market. The results of operations for the year
ended September 30, 1998 reflect an acceleration in the amortization of purchase
premiums on loans and mortgage-backed securities which increased from $1.1
million for the year ended September 30, 1997 to $11.4 million for the year
ended September 30, 1998. The increase in premium amortization was largely the
result of increased prepayments on purchased mortgage loans. Prepayments on
purchased mortgage loans also negatively affect interest income since such loans
are generally serviced by other entities who only remit funds received from
prepayments on a monthly basis, which results in a loss of interest income from
the delay in remittance and use of funds from such prepayments. As a result of
prepayments and because many of the loans purchased are adjustable-rate
mortgages in the "teaser" period, the yield on loans declined from 7.78% for the
year ended September 30, 1997 to 7.01% for the year ended September 30, 1998.
This 77 basis point drop in the yield earned on loans was a significant factor
in the decline of the yield on interest earning assets.

     The increase in interest expense of $91.5 million, or 120.4%, to $167.5
million for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $76.0 million for the year
ended September 30, 1997 primarily reflects an increase in interest expense on
interest-bearing deposits of $43.3 million, or 86.4%, to $93.4 million for the
year ended September 30, 1998, from $50.1 million for the year ended September
30, 1997, an increase in interest expense on FHLB advances of $32.9 million to
$51.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1998, from $18.7 million for the
year ended September 30, 1997, an increase in preferred dividends of the trust
subsidiaries of $10.5 million to $17.0 million for the year ended September 30,
1998 from $6.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1997 and an increase in
interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $5.0
million to $5.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1998 from $0.5 million
for the year ended September 30, 1997. This was due to an increase in average
interest-bearing deposits of $777.4 million, or 80.6%,to $1.7 billion for the
year ended September 30, 1998, from $964.4 million for the year ended September
30, 1997. Approximately $79.1 million of this increase represents deposits
acquired with Consumers and Central. The average rate paid on interest-bearing
deposits increased 16 basis points to 5.36% for the year ended September 30,
1998 from 5.20% for the year ended September 30, 1997.

     PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. The provision for loan losses for the year ended
September 30, 1998 was $1.7 million as compared with a provision for loan losses
of $1.3 million for the year ended September 30, 1997. The provision for loan
losses represents management's estimate of the charge to operations after
reviewing the nature, volume, delinquency status, and inherent risk in the loan
portfolio in relation to the allowance for loan losses. For a detailed
discussion of BankUnited's asset quality and allowance for loan losses, see
"--Discussion of Financial Condition Changes for the Years Ended September 30,
1998, 1997 and 1996--Credit Quality."

     NON-INTEREST INCOME. Non-interest income for the year ended September 30,
1998 was $6.2 million compared with $4.1 million for the year ended September
30, 1997, an increase of $2.1 million. Of this increase, $3.6 million represents
gains on the sale of loans and mortgage backed securities, partially offset by a
$2.3 million decrease in loan servicing fee income, net, primarily due to the
acceleration of amortization of mortgage servicing rights resulting from an
increase in prepayments. The remaining increase was primarily attributable to
service fees on deposits reflecting the increase in the amount of deposits
outstanding.

     NON-INTEREST EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased $9.3 million, or 40.6%,
to $32.2 million for the year ended September 30, 1998 compared to $22.9 million
for the year ended September 30, 1997. The increase in expenses was attributable
to the growth BankUnited has experienced including the expenses of Consumers'
and Central's operations.

     INCOME TAXES. The income tax provision was $5.0 million for each of the
years ended September 30, 1998 and 1997.

     PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. Preferred stock dividends for the year ended
September 30, 1998 were $0.9 million, a decrease of $2.0 million, as compared to
$2.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1997. This decrease is the result
of the retirement, in October 1997, of the 8% Noncumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series 1996, issued in connection with the acquisition of
Suncoast and ,in January 1998, of the Series 1993 Preferred Stock, partially
offset by the issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock in April 1998.

COMPARISON OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997
AND 1996

     NET INCOME AFTER PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. BankUnited had net income after
preferred stock dividends of $4.7 million for the year ended September 30, 1997,
compared to net income after preferred stock dividends of $441,000 for the year
ended September 30, 1996. All major categories of income and expense increased
significantly in the year ended September 30, 1997 as compared to the year ended
September 30, 1996 and reflect the significant growth BankUnited experienced in
fiscal 1997. A significant factor in such growth was the acquisition of
Suncoast, which was completed on November 15, 1996. BankUnited's Consolidated
Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 1997 reflects
Suncoast's operations from the date of acquisition. Below is a more detailed
discussion of each major category of income and expenses.

     NET INTEREST INCOME. Net interest income increased $13.9 million, or 78.8%,
to $31.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1997 from $17.6 million for
the year ended September 30, 1996. This increase was attributable to an increase
in average interest-earning assets of $726.0 million, or 104.3%, to $1.4 billion
for the year ended September 30, 1997 from $696.4 million for the year ended
September 30, 1996. Approximately $350 million of the increase in average
interest-earning assets for the year ended September 30, 1997 was a result of
the acquisition of Suncoast. The remaining increase in average interest-earning
assets is due primarily to loan purchases. The average yield on interest-earning
assets increased 16 basis points to 7.65% for the year ended September 30, 1997,
from 7.49% for the year ended September 30, 1996. The increase in average yield
was attributable to an increase in the yield on loans receivable relating
primarily to commercial real estate and construction loans acquired with
Suncoast. Suncoast had a greater percentage of higher yielding commercial real
estate and construction loans than the Bank.

     The increase in interest income of $56.6 million, or 108.8%, to $108.8
million for the year ended September 30, 1997 from $52.1 million for the year
ended September 30, 1996, primarily reflects increases in interest and fees on
loans of $53.3 million. The average yield on loans receivable increased to 7.78%
for the year ended September 30, 1997 from 7.65% for the year ended September
30, 1996 and the average balance of loans receivable increased $676.9 million,
or 125.3%, to $1.2 billion for the year ended September 30, 1997. Approximately
$300 million of the increase in loans was due to the acquisition of Suncoast
and, as stated above, the increase in the yield on loans was also attributed to
Suncoast.

     The increase in interest expense of $41.3 million, or 119.4%, to $76.0
million for the year ended September 30, 1997 from $34.6 million for the year
ended September 30, 1996 primarily reflects an increase in interest expense on
interest-bearing deposits of $29.3 million, or 141.1%, from $20.8 million for
the year ended September 30, 1996, to $50.1 million for the year ended September
30, 1997, an increase in interest expense on FHLB advances of $5 million from
$13.8 million for the year ended September 30, 1996 to $18.8 million for the
year ended September 30, 1997, and interest expense of $6.5 million on Trust
Preferred Securities which were issued in fiscal 1997. This increase was due to
an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $557.8 million, or 137.2%,
from $406.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1996 to $964.4 million for
the year ended September 30, 1997. Approximately $250 million of this increase
represents deposits acquired with Suncoast. The average rate paid on
interest-bearing deposits increased 9 basis points from 5.11% for the year ended
September 30, 1996 to 5.20% for the year ended September 30, 1997.

     PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES. The provision for loan losses for the year ended
September 30, 1997 was $1.3 million as compared with a credit for loan losses of
$120,000 for the year ended September 30, 1996. The credit in 1996 was due to a
recovery of approximately $1 million as a result of a legal settlement relating
to certain loans previously purchased. The provision for loan losses represents
management's estimate of the charge to operations after reviewing the nature,
volume, delinquency status, and inherent risk in the loan portfolio in relation
to the allowance for loan losses. For a detailed discussion of BankUnited's
asset quality and allowance for loan losses, see "--Discussion of Financial
Condition Changes for the Years Ended September 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995--Credit
Quality."

     NON-INTEREST INCOME. Non-interest income for the year ended September 30,
1997 was $4.1 million compared with $649,000 for the year ended September 30,
1996, an increase of $3.4 million. Of this increase, $1.6 million represents
loan servicing fees (net of amortization of capitalized servicing rights) from
operations acquired with Suncoast, and $819,000 represent gains on the sale of
loans and mortgage backed securities. The remaining increase was primarily
attributable to service fees on deposits reflecting the increase in the amount
of deposits outstanding.

     NON-INTEREST EXPENSES. Operating expenses increased $8.9 million, or 63.5%,
to $22.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1997 compared to $14.0 million
for the year ended September 30, 1996. The increase in expenses was attributable
to the growth BankUnited has experienced including the expenses of Suncoast's
operations. The year ended September 30, 1996 included a one time assessment to
replenish the Savings Association Insurance Fund ("SAIF") of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) of $2.6 million.

     INCOME TAXES. The income tax provision was $5.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 1997 compared to $1.7 million for the year ended September 30,
1996. The increase in income taxes was the result of BankUnited's higher pre-tax
earnings during the year ended September 30, 1997, compared to the year ended
September 30, 1996.

     PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS. Preferred stock dividends for the year ended
September 30, 1997 were $2.9 million, an increase of $745,000, as compared to
$2.1 million for the year ended September 30, 1996. This increase is the result
of dividends paid on the 8% Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series
1996, issued in connection with the acquisition of Suncoast and retired in
October, 1997, partially offset by the conversion of the Noncumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C and C-II in February 1997.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

     The business of the Company and the composition of its balance sheet
consists of investments in interest-earning assets (primarily loans,
mortgage-backed securities, and investment securities) which are primarily
funded by interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Such financial
instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest
rates resulting in market risk. Other than loans which are originated and held
for sale, all of the financial instruments of the Company are for other than
trading purposes.

     Interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and
interest rate indices of the interest-earning assets, interest-bearing
liabilities, and off-balance sheet financial instruments are different, creating
a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in
disproportionate changes in the value of, and the net earnings generated from,
the Company's interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and
off-balance sheet financial instruments. The Company's exposure to interest rate
risk is managed primarily through the Company's strategy of selecting the types
and terms of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which
generate favorable earnings, while limiting the potential negative effects of
changes in market interest rates. Since the Company's primary source of
interest-bearing liabilities is customer deposits, the Company's ability to
manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer
preferences in the market areas in which the Company operates. Borrowings, which
include FHLB advances, short-term borrowings, and long-term borrowings, are
generally structured with specific terms which in management's judgement, when
aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with
interest-earning assets, mitigate the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.
The rates, terms and interest rate indices of the Company's interest-earning
assets result primarily from the Company's strategy of investing in loans and
securities (a substantial portion of which have adjustable-rate terms) which
permit the Company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk, together with
credit risk, while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread
from the difference between the income earned on interest-earning assets and the
cost of interest-bearing liabilities (see "Business--Factors Affecting
Earnings--Asset and Liability Management" for a further discussion of rate
sensitive assets, rate sensitive liabilities and net interest spread).

SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED IN MANAGING INTEREST RATE RISK

     Managing the Company's exposure to interest rate risk involves significant
assumptions about the exercise of imbedded options and the relationship of
various interest rate indices of certain financial instruments.

     IMBEDDED OPTIONS. A substantial portion of the Company's loans and
mortgage-backed securities are residential mortgage loans containing significant
imbedded options which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of
the loan prior to maturity ("prepayments") without penalty. A loan's propensity
for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors, including, the current
interest rate and interest rate index (if any) on the loan, the financial
ability of the borrower to refinance, the economic benefit to be obtained from
refinancing, availability of refinancing at attractive terms, as well as
economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales
and price levels of residential property. In a changing interest rate
environment, prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed- and adjustable-rate
loans depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short-
and long-term interest rates. Since a significant portion of the Company's loans
are ARM loans, prepayments on such loans generally increase when long-term
interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short-term
interest rates making fixed-rate loans more desirable.

     Investment securities, other than those with early call provisions,
generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to
specific terms until maturity. While savings and checking deposits generally may
be withdrawn upon the customer's request without prior notice, a continuing
relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is
generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterruptible source of
funds. Time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties, while term FHLB
Advances have prepayment penalties, which discourage customer withdrawal of time
deposits and prepayment of FHLB Advances prior to maturity.

     The Company's trust preferred securities may be redeemed at varying times,
and as to $70 million of such securities, until 2016, at a premium. (See Note 12
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
trust preferred securities).

     INTEREST RATE INDICES. The Company's ARM loans and mortgage-backed
securities are primarily indexed to the One Year Constant Maturity Treasury
Index (see "Business--Lending Activities"). When such loans and mortgage-backed
securities are funded by interest-bearing liabilities which are determined by
other indices, primarily deposits and FHLB advances, a changing interest rate
environment may result in different levels of change in the different indices
leading to disproportionate changes in the value of, and the net earnings
generated from, the Company's financial instruments. Each index is unique and is
influenced

                                       45
<PAGE>



by different external factors, therefore, the historical relationships in
various indices may not necessarily be indicative of the actual change which may
result in a changing interest rate environment.

INTEREST RATE RISK MEASUREMENT

     In addition to periodic gap reports (see "Business--Factors Affecting
Earnings--Asset and Liability Management") comparing the sensitivity of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities to changes in interest
rates, management also utilizes a quarterly report ("model") prepared for the
Bank by the OTS based on information provided by the Bank which measures the
Bank's exposure to interest rate risk. The model calculates the present value of
assets, liabilities, off-balance sheet financial instruments, and equity at
current interest rates, and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at
one percent intervals. The present value of each major category of financial
instrument is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on
weighted average contractual rates and terms at discount rates representing the
estimated current market interest rate for similar financial instruments. The
present value of the interest rate caps is calculated by the model using
estimated cash flows based on the contractual rates and terms at a discount rate
representing the index to which the interest rate caps are tied. The resulting
present value of longer term fixed-rate financial instruments are more sensitive
to change in a higher or lower market interest rate scenario, while
adjustable-rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present
value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates
until the next interest rate repricing date.

     The following table reflects the estimated present value of
interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and off-balance sheet
financial instruments as calculated by the OTS for the Bank as of September 30,
1998, consolidated with the estimated present values of other financial
instruments of the Company, at current interest rates and at hypothetical higher
and lower interest rates of one and two percent.

     The calculations of present value have certain shortcomings. The discount
rates utilized for loans and mortgage-backed securities are based on estimated
market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide, with
prepayment levels generally assumed based on global statistics. The unique
characteristics of the Company's loans and mortgage-backed securities may not
necessarily parallel those assumed in the model, and therefore, would likely
result in different discount rates, prepayment

experiences, and present values. The discount rates utilized for deposits and
borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which
are not necessarily indicative of the present value of deposits and FHLB
Advances since such deposits and Advances are unique to, and have certain price
and customer relationship advantages for, depository institutions. The present
values are determined based on the discounted cash flows over the remaining
estimated lives of the financial instruments and assumes that the resulting cash
flows are reinvested in financial instruments with virtually identical terms.
The total measurement of the Company's exposure to interest rate risk as
presented in the above table may not be representative of the actual values
which might result from a higher or lower interest rate environment. A higher or
lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment
and borrowing strategies by the Company designed to further mitigate the effect
on the value of, and the net earnings generated from, the Company's net assets
from any change in interest rates.

     NET PORTFOLIO VALUE. The OTS adopted a final rule in August of 1993
incorporating an interest rate risk ("IRR") component into the risk-based
capital rules (see "Regulation"). The IRR component is a dollar amount that is
deducted from total capital for the purpose of calculating an institution's
risk-based capital requirement and is measured in terms of the sensitivity of
its net portfolio value ("NPV") to changes in interest rates. An institution's
NPV is calculated as the net discounted cash flows from assets, liabilities, and
off-balance sheet contracts. An institution's IRR component is measured as the
change in the ratio of NPV to the net present value of total assets as a result
of a hypothetical 200 basis point change in market interest rates. A resulting
decline in this ratio of more than 2% of the estimated present value of an
institution's total assets prior to the hypothetical 200 basis point change will
require the institution to deduct from its regulatory capital 50% of that excess
decline. Implementation of the rule has been postponed indefinitely.

     The following table presents the Bank's ratio of NPV to the present value
of total assets as of September 30, 1998, as calculated by the OTS, based on
information provided to the OTS by the Bank.

</TABLE>


     Certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in
the foregoing table. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may
have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different
degrees to changes in market interest rates. Also, the interest rates on certain
types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market
interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in
market rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgage
loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term
basis and over the life of the loan. Further, in the event of a change in
interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate
significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables. Finally, the ability
of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a
significant interest rate increase.

     In addition, the previous table does not necessarily indicate the impact of
general interest rate movements on the Company's net interest income because the
repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities are subject to
competitive and other pressures beyond the Company's control. As a result,
certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing
within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and at
different volumes.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS. The
Company has purchased and intends to continue to purchase a significant amount
of residential mortgage loans. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 1998
and 1997, the Company purchased $2.7 billion and $913.7 million, respectively,
of one-to-four family residential loans, of which $2.0 billion and $728.2
million, respectively, were ARM loans. At September 30, 1998 the Company's
residential loan portfolio included $1.6 billion of ARMs (55.2% of the Company's
gross loan portfolio). The ARMs purchased by the Company have annual interest
rate adjustment caps that limit rate increases or decreases to 2% per year.
Further, a portion of the ARMs purchased by the Company provide for initial
rates of interest below the rates which would prevail were the contractual index
and margin used for repricing applied initially (the "teaser rate period").


                                       48
<PAGE>


     If market interest rates rise rapidly, the annual and lifetime interest
rate adjustment caps on the ARMs may limit the increase in the interest rates on
ARMs relative to the increase in market interest rates, and yields on ARMs with
teaser rates may be limited to repricing at interest rates below the contractual
index plus the margin. At September 30, 1998, $492.4 million of the Company's
ARM loans (17.3% of the Company's gross loan portfolio) were in the teaser rate
period with an average teaser rate of 6.21% and an average fully indexed rate of
7.48%. Rapid increases in market interest rates may not be fully reflected in
loans which are in the teaser rate period and may, accordingly, have a negative
impact on the Company's net interest margin.

     REFINANCING RISKS. A significant portion of the Company's loans receivable
are single-family residential mortgages that generally have an imbedded option
that allows the borrower to prepay the loan at any time without penalty. A
substantial portion of these loans have been purchased by the Company in the
secondary mortgage market at a premium.

     In the current interest rate environment, when long-term interest rates are
generally low on a historical basis and the spread between short-term rates and
long-term rates is relatively narrow, prepayments of ARMs and higher fixed-rate
mortgages tend to accelerate. In addition, at September 30, 1998, $492.4 million
of the Company's ARMs had teaser rates, which will be subject to interest rate
adjustments within the next twelve months. Teaser rate loans may tend to be
prepaid near the end of the teaser period in the current interest rate
environment, creating higher levels of prepayments on loans overall which the
Company may not be able to reinvest quickly enough and at sufficient interest
rates to mitigate the effect on it net interest margin.

     Premiums, net of discounts and deferred origination costs, which at
September 30, 1998 were $29.9 million, are recognized as a reduction to interest
income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans adjusted
for estimated prepayments, based on the Company's historical prepayment
experience. As prepayments accelerate, the Company's historical prepayment
experience changes, resulting in a shortening of the estimated life of the loan
portfolio, and an increase in the rate at which premiums are expensed, resulting
in a greater reduction in interest income. Accelerated prepayments could,
therefore, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations. Based on a continuation of the current interest rate environment, a
significant portion of the premium may be expensed in a relatively short term
period.

     AVAILABILITY OF MORTGAGE LOANS. The Company's net income depends
significantly on its ability to acquire mortgage loans an acceptable terms and
at favorable spreads over the Company's borrowing costs. If the Company is
unable to acquire mortgage loans, its results of operations will be adversely
affected.

     In acquiring mortgage loans, the Company will compete with REITs,
investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage
bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, other lenders, FNMA, FHLMC, GNMA and
other entities purchasing mortgage loans, some of which have greater financial
resources than the Company. Increased competition for the acquisition of
eligible mortgage loans or a diminution in the supply could result in higher
prices and, thus, lower yields on such mortgage loans that could further narrow
the yield spread over borrowing costs.

     The availability of mortgage loans meeting the Company's criteria is
dependent upon, among other things, the size and level of activity in the
residential real estate lending market, which depends on various factors,
including the level of interest rates, regional and national economic conditions
and changes in residential real estate values. To the extent the Company is
unable to acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage loans meeting its criteria,
the Company's results of operations would be adversely affected.

     RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. The
Company purchases fixed and adjustable rate mortgage-backed and other securities
for liquidity, yield and risk management purposes. The Company has also, and
will continue to, securitize whole loans in its loan portfolio primarily for
liquidity and collateral purposes. Such securities provide liquidity through the
ability of the Company to dispose of certain securities from time to time and
the ability of the Company to use securities as collateral for borrowings,
thereby adding leverage capability and lower borrowing costs. Certain securities
are purchased for risk management purposes when the terms of those securities
mitigate interest rate, credit, prepayment or basis risk within the Company's
balance sheet. Certain purchases of securities may increase risk in one area
while decreasing risk in another, or may not mitigate any existing risk. The
Company manages its exposure to risk in its acquisition of securities through
its selection of prices, collateral and terms. Changes in market interest rates
and/or prepayment rates associated with the Company's investments and
mortgage-backed securities could negatively impact the Company's net interest
margin.

BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The accounting and reporting policies of BankUnited Financial
Corporation (the "Company") and subsidiaries conform to generally accepted
accounting principles and to general practices within the savings and loan
industry. Presented below is a description of the Company and its principal
accounting policies.

(A) BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

         The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries, including BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"). The Bank
provides a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers
through its branches in South and West Florida. The Bank is subject to the
regulations of certain federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by
those regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.

         The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing the consolidated
financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated statements of financial condition and operations for the period.

         Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant
change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan
losses and the allowance for losses on tax certificates, the effect of
prepayments on premiums on purchased loans, the valuation of mortgage servicing
rights, and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with
foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. Premiums on purchased loans are
amortized based, in part, on management's estimate of future prepayment rates.
If actual prepayments exceed these estimates, premium amortization is increased
through charges to interest income in the period the excess prepayments occur.
In connection with the determination of the allowances for loan losses and real
estate owned, management obtains independent appraisals for properties.

(B) MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS

         Mortgage-backed securities and other investments available for sale are
carried at fair value (market value), inclusive of unrealized gains and losses,
and net of discount accretion and premium amortization computed using the level
yield method. Net unrealized gains and losses are reflected as a separate
component of stockholders' equity, net of applicable deferred income taxes.

         Mortgage-backed securities and investments held to maturity are carried
at amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities and investment securities that the
Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are designated
as held-to-maturity securities.

         Gains or losses on sales of mortgage securities and investments are
recognized on the specific identification basis.

         Tax certificates are considered investments held to maturity and,
accordingly, are carried at cost less a valuation allowance. Interest is accrued
on tax certificates until payoff or until deemed uncollectible. When deemed
uncollectible, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Applicable law
permits application for tax deeds to be applied for two years after the
effective date of the acquisition of the tax certificate. Tax deeds applied for
are carried at the cost of the tax certificates, adjusted for accrued interest.
Tax deeds applied for carry an annual interest rate of 18%.

(C) ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

         A provision for losses on loans is charged to operations when, in
management's opinion, the collectibility of the balances is doubtful and the
carrying value is greater than the fair value, net of selling costs, of
collateral dependent loans or the estimated net realizable value of other loans.
The provision is based upon a review of the nature, volume, delinquency status
and inherent risk of the loan portfolio in relation to the allowance for loan
losses.

         Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate.
While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future
additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic
conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral part of
their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses.
Such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgments
about information available to them at the time of their examination.

         The Company's non-accrual policy provides that all loans are placed on
non-accrual status when they are more than 90 days past due as to either
principal or interest, unless the loan is fully secured and in the process of
collection. Loans are returned to accrual status when they become less than 90
days delinquent.

BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED)

(D) LOANS RECEIVABLE

         Loans receivable are considered long-term investments and, accordingly,
are carried at historical cost. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of
cost or market, determined in the aggregate. In determining cost, deferred loan
origination fees and costs are adjusted to the principal balances of the related
loans.

(E) LOAN ORIGINATION FEES, COMMITMENT FEES, LOAN PREMIUMS AND RELATED COSTS

         Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest
income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans,
adjusted for estimated prepayments based on the Company's historical prepayment
experience. Commitment fees and costs relating to commitments, of which the
likelihood of exercise is remote, are recognized over the commitment period on a
straight-line basis. If the commitment is subsequently exercised during the
commitment period, the remaining unamortized commitment fee at the time of
exercise is recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.

         Premiums paid on purchased loans are capitalized and recognized as an
adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans, adjusted
for estimated prepayments based on the Company's historical prepayment
experience. If actual prepayments exceed those estimated by the Company, premium
amortization is increased through charges to interest income in the period the
excess prepayments occur.

(F) OTHER INTEREST EARNING ASSETS

         Other interest earning assets includes Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta ("FHLB") stock and an equity investment in the Community Reinvestment
Group. The fair value is estimated to be the carrying value which is par.

(G) OFFICE PROPERTIES AND EQUIPMENT

         Office properties and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the estimated
service lives of the assets for furniture, fixtures and equipment (7 to 10
years), and computer equipment and software (3 to 5 years), or with leases, the
term of the lease or the useful life (10 years), whichever is shorter. Repair
and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred, and improvements
are capitalized.

(H) ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE

         Recognition of interest on the accrual method is generally discontinued
when interest or principal payments are greater than 90 days in arrears, unless
the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. At the time a loan is
placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against interest income in the current period.

(I) REAL ESTATE OWNED

         Property acquired through foreclosure or deeds in lieu of foreclosures
are recorded at the lower of the related principal balance at foreclosure or
estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. Any excess of
the loan balance over the carrying value is charged to the allowance for loan
losses when the property is classified as real estate owned. The carrying value
is reviewed periodically and, when necessary, any decline in the value of the
real estate is charged to expense. Significant property improvements which
enhance the salability of the property are capitalized to the extent that the
carrying values do not exceed their estimated realizable values. Maintenance and
carrying costs on the property are charged to operations as incurred.

(J) IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

         Long-lived assets, assets to be disposed of and certain identifiable
intangibles, such as mortgage servicing rights, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability,
the Company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying
amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized. Measurement of an impairment
loss for long-lived assets, assets to be disposed of and identifiable
intangibles that an entity expects to hold and use is based upon the fair value
of the asset.

(K) GOODWILL

         Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated
beneficial life of 10 to 25 years. Goodwill is evaluated by management for
impairment on an annual basis based upon undiscounted cash flows of the related
net assets acquired.

SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES--(CONTINUED)

(L) INCOME TAXES

         The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
Deferred income taxes have been provided for elements of income and expense
which are recognized for financial reporting purposes in periods different than
such items are recognized for income tax purposes. The Company accounts for
income taxes utilizing the liability method, which applies the enacted statutory
rates in effect at the statement of financial condition date to differences
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The resulting deferred
tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws.

(M) EARNINGS PER SHARE

         Basic earnings per common share is computed on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number
of common shares outstanding for the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and
1996 were 15,693,000, 8,211,000, and 4,306,000, respectively. Earnings per
common share, assuming dilution, assume the maximum dilutive effect of the
average number of shares from stock options and the conversion equivalents of
preferred stocks and certain warrants. The weighted average number of diluted
common shares outstanding during the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and
1996 were 16,667,000, 9,148,000 and 4,558,000, respectively. Stock dividends
have been included in the calculation of earnings per share for all years
presented.

(N) STOCK OPTIONS

         When stock options are granted to employees and directors, a
determination is made of any compensation component based on the excess, if any,
of the fair market value of the underlying stock and the option price of the
grant. The proceeds from the exercise of options are credited to common stock
for the par value of the shares issued, and the excess, adjusted for any tax
benefit, is credited to paid-in capital. (See Note 15.)

(O) IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

         In June 1996, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 125 "Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities" and in
December 1996, the FASB issued a related Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 127, "Deferral of the Effective Date of Certain Provisions of FASB
Statement No. 125" (collectively "SFAS No. 125"). SFAS No. 125 provides
accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial
assets and extinguishment of liabilities based on a financial components
approach that focuses on control. Portions of SFAS No. 125 were effective for
transactions entered into after December 31, 1996 with the remaining portions
effective for transactions entered into after December 31, 1997. The impact of
adopting SFAS No. 125 has not been material to the Company's financial position
or the results of operations.

     In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 "Earnings per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"). SFAS No. 128 specifies
the computation, presentation and disclosure requirements for earnings per
share. It replaces primary earnings per share and fully diluted earnings per
share with basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share and is
effective for reporting periods ending after December 15, 1997. All amounts
presented have been restated to conform to the requirements of SFAS No. 128.

     In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 129, "Disclosure of Information about Capital Structure" ("SFAS
No. 129"). SFAS No. 129 continues previous requirements to disclose certain
information about an entity's capital structure. The Company currently complies
with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 129.

         In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income" ("SFAS No. 130"), which
requires that an enterprise report, by major components and as a single total,
the change in its net assets during the period from non-owner sources; and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"), which establishes
annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments
and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas, and
major customers. Adoption of these statements will not impact the Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and any
effect will be limited to the form and content of its disclosures. Both
statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997,
with earlier application permitted.

         In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"
("SFAS No. 133") which is effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 1999 (October 1, 1999 for the Company). SFAS No. 133
requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at
their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are
recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income,
depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedge
transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction as set forth in the
guidance. The Company currently utilizes derivative instruments on a limited
basis to hedge the interest rate risks of certain financial instruments.
Interest Rate Cap contracts have been acquired by the Company to hedge the risk
on an increase in market interest rates for variable rate sources of funds which
are partially funding financial instruments which

have interest rate terms which are fixed for certain periods of time (see Note
17 "Commitments and Contingencies" for further discussion of the Interest Rate
Cap contracts). The Interest Rate Cap contracts will be treated as cash flow
hedges under SFAS No. 133 and it is anticipated that any change in their fair
value will be substantially offset by an opposite change in the fair value of
the financial instruments designated in the hedge transaction. Under SFAS No.
133, the portion of change in fair value of any derivative instrument designated
as a hedge which is not effective will be recognized in current period earnings.
Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 133 for its current
derivative instruments to have any material effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

         In October 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 134, "Accounting for
Mortgage-Backed Securities Retained after the Securitization of Mortgage Loans
Held for Sale by a Mortgage Banking Enterprise" ("SFAS No. 134") which applies
to mortgage banking enterprises and other entities conducting similar
operations. SFAS No. 134 requires that securities retained after a
securitization of loans held for sale be accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 115, unless the entity has entered into a commitment to sell the retained
securities before or during the securitization process. Such securities would be
classified as trading. SFAS No. 134 is effective for the first fiscal quarter
beginning after December 15, 1998. The adoption of SFAS No. 134 is not expected
to be material to the Company's financial position or results of operations.

(3) ACQUISITIONS

   On November 15, 1996, the Company acquired Suncoast Savings & Loan
Association, FSA ("Suncoast"). The Company issued one share of its Class A
Common Stock for each share of Suncoast common stock of which 2,199,930 were
outstanding and one share of newly created 8% Noncumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series 1996 for each share of Suncoast preferred stock of which
920,000 shares were outstanding. The 8% Noncumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series 1996 had substantially the same terms and conditions as the
Suncoast preferred stock. The cost of the acquisition, which was accounted for
as a purchase, was $27.8 million, representing the fair value of the
consideration given to the Suncoast common and preferred stockholders as well as
the option and warrant holders. In addition, the Company incurred approximately
$1.3 million of costs directly related to the merger. The balance sheet and
results of operations of Suncoast have been included with those of BankUnited as
of and for periods subsequent to November 15, 1996.

   As part of the purchase of Suncoast, the Company issued warrants to
Suncoast's warrant holders to purchase 80,000 shares of 8% Noncumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1996, and assumed Suncoast's outstanding
stock options. The warrants were exercisable to purchase one share of the 8%
Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series 1996 at a per share price of
$18.00, or to purchase 1.68595 shares, subject to adjustment, of Class A Common
Stock at a per share price of $10.68, also subject to adjustment under certain
conditions. A total of 42,655 warrants were converted into 71,259 shares of
Class A Common Stock during June 1998. The 5,545 warrants which remained
unexercised after July 9, 1998 expired pursuant to the terms of the warrant
agreements.

   At the date of acquisition, the fair value of the assets and liabilities
acquired from Suncoast were as follows (in thousands):

   The proforma combined condensed statement of operations assumes the
acquisition occurred as of October 1, 1995.

   On January 23, 1998, the Company acquired Consumers Bancorp, Inc.
("Consumers") for approximately $12 million in a combination of cash and stock
and merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Consumers Savings Bank, which had assets
of $104.4 million and deposits of $88.3 million as of January 23, 1998, into the
Bank. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in goodwill
of approximately $5.6 million. This acquisition did not have a material impact
on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.

   On June 19, 1998, the Company acquired Central Bank ("Central"), for
1,386,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, and merged Central,
which had assets of $93.9 million and deposits of $65.9 million as of June 19,
1998 into the Bank. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted
in goodwill of approximately $12.8 million. This acquisition did not have a
material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.

(4) TAX CERTIFICATES

   Tax certificates are certificates representing delinquent real estate taxes
owed to the respective counties. A substantial percentage of tax certificates
are for properties located in southeast Florida. The Company's policy is to
purchase tax certificates only for properties located in Florida.

   The net carrying value of tax certificates was $40.0 million and $49.3
million at September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Included in these amounts
at September 30, 1998 and 1997 were $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively,
of tax certificates for which the Company had made application for tax deeds.
The Company maintains loss reserves for tax certificates which were $469,000 and
$697,000 at September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

   The estimated market values of the Company's tax certificates are the same as
the carrying values, since historically the tax certificates have had relatively
short lives and their yields approximate market rates.

(5) SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL

   Interest income from securities purchased under agreements to resell
aggregated approximately $2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 1998.

   Under the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulations adopted to implement
the "prompt corrective action" provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the "FDICIA"), a "well capitalized"
institution must have a risk- based capital ratio of 10%, a core capital ratio
of 5% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. (The "Tier 1 risk-based
capital" ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets.) The Bank
is a well capitalized institution under the definitions as adopted. Regulatory
capital and net income amounts as of and for the years ended September 30, 1998,
1997 and 1996 did not differ from regulatory capital and net income amounts
reported to the OTS.

   On August 31, 1993, the OTS adopted an amendment to its regulatory capital
regulations to take into account a savings institution's exposure to the risk of
loss from changing interest rates. Under the regulation as amended, a savings
institution with an above normal level of interest rate risk exposure will be
required to deduct an interest rate risk ("IRR") component from its total
capital when determining its compliance with the risk-based capital
requirements. An "above normal" level of interest rate risk exposure is a
projected decline of 2% in the net present value of an institution's assets and
liabilities resulting from a 2% swing in interest rates. The IRR component will
equal one-half of the difference between the institution's measured interest
rate exposure and the "normal" level of exposure. Savings institutions will be
required to file data with the OTS that the OTS will use to calculate, on a
quarterly basis (but with a two-quarter lag), institutions' measured interest
rate risk and IRR components. Implementation of the IRR requirements have been
delayed pending the testing of the OTS appeals process. If the IRR component had
been required as of September 30, 1998, the Bank would not have been required to
deduct an IRR component from its total capital when determining its compliance
with its risk-based capital requirements.

   Payment of dividends by the Bank is limited by federal regulations, which
provide for certain levels of permissible dividend payments depending on the
Bank's regulatory capital and other relevant factors.

     by the Board of Directors. As of September 30, 1998, 10,000,000 shares of
     Preferred Stock were authorized, of which 7,012,628 shares were not

NONCUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A:

     Effective September 30, 1995, pursuant to an Offer to Exchange Preferred

         Preferred Stock for one share of the Company's Noncumulative
         Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B. Because the dividend rate,
         redemption price, and the liquidation preference for the Series B
         Preferred Stock are lower than those for the Series A Preferred Stock,
         the Company agreed not to redeem the shares of Series B Preferred Stock

         share. Effective October 1, 1997, the Company agreed, in exchange for
         the reduction in the dividend rate described above, not to redeem the
         Series B Preferred Stock until October 1, 2007 or later unless earlier

     (1)  On September 3, 1998, the Company repriced options to purchase Class A
          Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock which
          had exercise prices which exceeded the fair market value of the
          underlying stock on that date. As a result of this repricing the
          exercise price of options to purchase 302,850 shares of Class A Common
          Stock and 77,500 shares of Class B Common Stock was reduced to $9.298
          per share, and the exercise price of options to purchase 315,000
          shares of Series B Preferred Stock was reduced to $13.909 per share.

     (2)  On October 14, 1998, the Company repriced options to purchase Class A
          Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock which
          had exercise prices which exceeded the fair market value of the
          underlying stock on that date. As a result of this repricing the
          exercise price of options to purchase 456,368 shares of Class A Common
          Stock and 595,800 shares of Class B Common Stock was reduced to $7.25
          per share, and the exercise price of options to purchase 315,000
          shares of Series B Preferred Stock was reduced to $10.8452 per share.
          The aggregate option price is reduced to approximately $14.4 million
          as a result of this reduction.

         The Company has adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" and as permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company continues to follow
the measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Option No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, " and, accordingly, does not
recognize compensation expense for its stock-based incentive plans. Had
compensation cost for the Company's stock based incentive compensation plans
been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under
those plans consistent with the methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123, the
Company's net income and earnings per share for fiscal 1998, 1997 and 1996 would
have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below:

     The Company has a 401(k) savings plan pursuant to which eligible employees
are permitted to contribute up to 15% of their annual salary to the savings
plan. Currently, the Company intends to make matching contributions at a rate of
33% of such contributions, up to a maximum of 6% of an employee's salary. The
amount of such matching by the Company for the years ended September 30, 1998,
1997, and 1996 totaled approximately $71,900, $34,600, and $7,000 respectively.
Employees are eligible to participate in the plan after one year of service and
begin vesting in the company's contribution after two years of participation in
the plan at the rate of 25% per year up to 100%.

     The Company's Board of Directors adopted a Profit Sharing Plan. Under the
terms of the plan, the Company, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, may
contribute Class A Common Stock to the plan. The contributions are allocated to
the account of the eligible employees based upon their salaries. Employees
become eligible for the plan after one year of service and become vested at the
rate of 20% per year, after the third year, up to 100%. The Board of Directors
authorized a contribution of $100,000, $170,000 and $100,000 in 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.

     In connection with the Suncoast acquisition the Company assumed 119,000 of
Suncoast's options with option prices ranging from $3.00 to $7.38 per share of
Class A Common Stock with an aggregate exercise price of $610,000. As of
September 30, 1998, all of these options had been exercised.

         At September 30, 1998, the Company had $565,000 in Tax Bad Debt
Reserves originating before December 31, 1987 for which deferred taxes have not
been provided. The amount becomes taxable under the Internal Revenue Code upon
the occurrence of certain events, including certain non-dividend distributions.
The Company does not anticipate any actions which would ultimately result in the
recapture of this amount for income tax purposes.

     In connection with the acquisition of Suncoast, the Company recorded
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the differences between values assigned
in purchase accounting and the tax bases of acquired assets and liabilities. The
resultant net deferred tax asset is not included in the summary of significant
temporary differences at September 30, 1996 above. Approximately $2,635,000 of
this deferred tax asset has been recognized as deferred tax expense during the
year ended September 30, 1997 and $1,605,000 represents the tax effect at
September 30, 1997 of amounts deductible for tax purposes in future periods.

     The Company also acquired net deferred tax assets of approximately
$1,140,000 in conjunction with its acquisition of Suncoast. These net deferred
tax assets are not included in the summary of significant temporary differences
at September 30, 1996 above.

     In connection with the acquisition of Consumers and Central, the Company
recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities for the differences between values
assigned in purchase accounting and the tax bases of acquired assets and
liabilities. With respect to the Consumers and Central acquisitions,
approximately $19,000 and $7,000, respectively, of net deferred tax assets have
been recognized as net deferred tax benefit during the year ended September 30,
1998 and $287,000 and $16,000, respectively, represent the tax effect at
September 30, 1998 of amounts not deductible for tax purposes in future periods.

     The Company also acquired net deferred tax liabilities of approximately
$189,000 in connection with its acquisition of Consumers and net deferred tax
assets of approximately $332,000 in connection with its acquisition of Central.


(17) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     In the normal course of business, the Company enters into instruments that
are not recorded in the consolidated financial statements, but are required to
meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, purchase whole loans and securities, standby letters of credit
and derivative financial instruments. Those instruments involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contract
or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the
Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.

     The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party on the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount
and collateral value, if any, of those instruments.

     Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Total commitments to extend credit at
September 30, 1998 were as follows:

     The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company,
upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the
customer. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, property, plant
and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial
properties.

     Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company requires
collateral to support those commitments.

     During April 1998, the Bank entered into two interest rate cap contracts
with a major Wall Street firm, in notional amounts of $90.0 million and $60.0
million, terminating on October 23, 1999 and April 23, 2000, respectively. The
contracts require the counter-party to pay the Bank quarterly interest payments
based on the notional amounts and the difference between the "London Inter Bank
Offering Rate", ( the "LIBOR rate") and 5.90% when the LIBOR rate exceeds 5.90%,
in return for a one-time payment by the Bank.

     During May 1998, the Bank entered into a third interest rate cap contract
with another major Wall Street firm in a notional amount of $75.0 million
terminating on May 30, 2000. The contract requires the counter-party to pay the
Bank quarterly interest payments based on the notional amount and the difference
between the LIBOR rate and 6.10% when the LIBOR rate exceeds 6.10%, in return
for a one-time payment by the Bank.

The Bank entered into these contracts for the purpose of hedging a portion of
the Company's interest rate risk for rising interest rates. As of September 30,
1998, the 3-month LIBOR rate was 5.42%.

     The following table provides additional information regarding the interest
rate caps:

     The interest rate caps are accounted for as a non-trading hedge for rising
interest rates against certain short-term borrowings.


     During November 1998, the Bank completed a program to issue up to $500
million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes backed by an irrevocable
standby letter of credit of the FHLB of Atlanta. These notes may have either a
fixed or floating rate of interest determined at the time of issuance and will
mature no sooner than 9 months and no more than 10 years from the date of issue.
The Bank intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general
corporate purposes that will ultimately promote home financing or other housing
activity and encourage and assist the Bank's asset/liability management. The
notes have been rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and "AAA" by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.

     The Company is a party to certain other claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the resolution of
such claims and litigation will not materially affect the Company's consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

(18) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Company employs the services of a law firm, of which the Company's
Chairman of the Board and President is senior managing director and of which
another director of the Company is managing director; and the services of an
insurance agency, of which a member of the Board of Directors is a vice
president. For the years ended September 30, 1998, 1997 and 1996, total fees (a
portion of which were capitalized) paid to this law firm totaled approximately
$2.2 million, $2.2 million, and $986,000, respectively, and amounts paid to this
insurance company totaled approximately $445,000, $373,000, and $147,000,
respectively.

     In fiscal 1997, the Company leased property for a new branch, which is 25%
owned by the Company's Chairman of the Board. The lease is for a term of 3 years
with four, three year options to renew. The annual rent for the property is
approximately $138,000.

BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 1998

(20) ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

         The information set forth below provides disclosure of the estimated
fair value of the Company's financial instruments. Management has made estimates
of fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable. However, because
there is no market for many of these financial instruments, management has no
basis to determine whether the fair value presented would be indicative of the
value negotiated in an actual sale. The fair value estimates do not consider the
tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or
liabilities at their fair value estimates.

         Fair values are estimated for loan portfolios with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by category, such as commercial,
commercial real estate, residential mortgage, second mortgages, and other
installment. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable
rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing status. The fair value
of loans, except residential mortgage and adjustable rate loans, is calculated
by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using
estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit risk inherent in the
loan. The estimate of average maturity is based on historical experience with
prepayments for each loan classification modified, as required, by an estimate
of the effect of current economic and lending conditions.

         For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated by discounting
contractual cash flows adjusted for national historical prepayment estimates
using discount rates based on secondary market sources adjusted to reflect
differences in servicing and credit costs.

         The fair value of the tax certificates is estimated at book value as
these investments historically have had relatively short lives and their yields
approximate market rates. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities and
investment securities is estimated based on bid prices available from securities
dealers.

         The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
non-interest-bearing demand deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market
accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of
certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows. The discount rate is estimated using the Company's current rates for
deposits of similar maturities adjusted for insurance costs.

         The fair value of the 10-1/4% Trust Preferred Securities is estimated
at book value as these securities are privately-placed and have no active
market. The fair value of the 9.60% and 9% Trust Preferred Securities is
estimated based on quoted market prices.

instruments at September 30, 1998 and 1997:

                              SHAREHOLDER AGREEMENT

         By this agreement (this "Agreement"), BankUnited Financial Corporation
(the "Company") and the holders (the "Holders") of the Company's Noncumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), agree as
follows, effective as of October 1, 1997:

         1.       Notwithstanding the annual dividend rate of $0.7375 stated in
                  Section 2 of the Statement of Designation for the Series B
                  Preferred Stock (the "Statement of Designation"), Appendix C
                  to the Company's Articles of Incorporation, the Holders agree
                  that they shall accept, when, as, and if declared by the Board
                  of Directors and out of the assets of the Company which are by
                  law available for the payment of dividends, preferential cash
                  dividends payable quarterly on the last day of February, May,
                  August and November of each year (unless such day is a
                  non-business day, in which event on the next business day), at
                  the fixed annual rate of $0.55 per share and no more.

         2.       In consideration of this decrease in the annual dividend rate,
                  and notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 of the
                  Statement of Designation, the Company agrees it shall not
                  redeem any of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock prior
                  to October 1, 2007, unless such redemption is approved by the
                  holders of at least 50% of the outstanding shares of the
                  Series B Preferred Stock.

         3.       This Agreement shall not be deemed to modify or cancel any
                  other rights of the Holders, not expressly changed herein.

         4.       This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
                  each of which shall be deemed to constitute an original, but
                  all of which together shall constitute one and the same
                  instrument.

         hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing with the
         Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or

to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with
respect to other Holders, and any notice which is mailed in the manner herein
provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given. In case, by
reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other
cause, it shall be impracticable to give notice by mail, then such notification

constitute sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.

         obligations of the Bank, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
         except as enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
         or other laws relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors' rights

<PAGE>





Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual knowledge of any Event of Default

reinstated in full or (iii) if a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received
a Bank Request pursuant to Section 401.

         (f) Notwithstanding any Bank Order to authenticate and deliver any

                  or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board
                  Resolutions, exclusive of Notes authenticated and delivered
                  under Sections 305 and 306.

         (g) No Notes shall be authenticated by the Trustee unless it shall have
received all instructions, directions and/or accompanying documentation required
pursuant to this Section. Notwithstanding any instructions or directions
received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 301(b), if the Trustee shall
receive, prior to the time of delivery of the relevant Notes, written or
telephonic instructions (which telephonic instructions shall be promptly
confirmed in writing) from the Bank or the FHLB of Atlanta not to authenticate
or deliver Notes, which instructions may be specific with respect to a
particular issue of Notes or may be general and applicable to all Notes
authenticated and delivered, after receipt of such instructions until revoked or
superseded by further written instructions from the Bank or the FHLB of Atlanta,
the Trustee shall not authenticate or deliver Notes and, subject to Section 601,
the Bank shall hold the Trustee harmless against liability arising from the
Trustee's compliance with this provision.

SECTION 302.      DENOMINATIONS.

         The Notes shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons in
a minimum denomination of $250,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess
thereof.

SECTION 303.      EXECUTION, AUTHENTICATION AND DELIVERY; TERMS.

         The Notes shall all be executed on behalf of the Bank by its Chairman
of the Board, a Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice
Presidents and by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries under its
corporate seal reproduced thereon or affixed thereto. The signature of any of
these officers on the Notes may be manual or facsimile.

         Notes bearing the manual or facsimile Signatures of individuals who
were at any time the proper officers of the Bank shall bind the Bank,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of


                                      18


<PAGE>





them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Notes.

         Forthwith upon the execution and delivery of this Indenture, or from
time to time thereafter, Notes may be executed by the Bank and delivered to the
Trustee for authentication, and, subject to Section 301, shall thereupon be
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee upon Bank Order, without any further
action by the Bank.

         Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication and bear its
Original Issue Date or the Original Issue Date of its Predecessor Note first in
time and shall mature on the Stated Maturity set forth on the face of such Note.
No Note shall have a Stated Maturity which (i) is less than nine months or more
than 10 years or such later date as may be set by the Bank pursuant to a Board
resolution from its Original Issue Date or (ii) is a date that is later than two
Business Days prior to the Business Day on which the Letter of Credit expires.

         No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Note a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by or on behalf of the Trustee by manual Signature, and such
certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence that such has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture.

SECTION 304.      TEMPORARY NOTES.

         Pending the preparation of definitive Notes, the Bank may execute, and
upon Bank Order, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Notes
which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise
produced, in any authorized denominations, substantially of the tenor of the
definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued, with such appropriate
insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers
executing such Notes may determine, as evidenced by their signatures on such
Notes.

         If temporary Notes are issued, the Bank will cause definitive Notes to
be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive
Notes, the temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes upon
surrender of the temporary Notes at each office or agency of the Bank maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002, without charge to the Holder. Upon
surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Bank shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a
like principal amount of definitive Notes of authorized denominations having the
identical Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and provisions with respect to
payment of interest as such temporary Notes. Until so exchanged, the temporary
Notes shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Notes.

SECTION 305.      REGISTRATION, TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE.

         The Bank shall cause to be kept at an office or agency to be
maintained by the Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 1002, a
register (herein sometimes referred to as the "Note Register") in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Bank shall
provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes as herein
provided. The 


                                      19


<PAGE>





Trustee is hereby appointed "Note Registrar" for the purpose of registering
Notes and transfers and exchanges of Notes as herein provided.

         Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at any office
or agency of the Bank maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002, the
Bank shall execute, and the Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver,
in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes
of any authorized denominations of a like aggregate principal amount having the
identical Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and provisions with respect to
payment of interest.

         At the option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of
any authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount having the
identical Original Issue Date, Stated Maturity and provisions with respect to
payment of Redemption Premium, if any and interest, upon surrender of the Notes
to be exchanged at such office or agency, and upon payment, if the Bank shall so
require, of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any Notes are so
surrendered for exchange, the Bank shall execute, and the Authenticating Agent
shall authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the Holder making the exchange
is entitled to receive.

         All Notes issued upon any transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the
valid obligations of the Bank, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the
same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered for such transfer
or exchange.

         Every Note presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if
so required by the Bank or the Authenticating Agent) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Bank, the Authenticating Agent and the Note Registrar, duly executed by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

         No service charge to the Holder will be made for any transfer or
exchange of Notes. The Bank may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges expressly provided in this
Indenture to be made at the Bank's own expense or without expense or without
charge to the Holders.

         The provisions of Clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) below shall apply only
to Global Notes:

                  (1) Each Global Note authenticated under this Indenture shall
         be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global
         Note or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee
         thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Note shall
         constitute a single Note for all purposes of this Indenture.

                  (2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no
         Global Note may be exchanged in whole or in part for Notes registered,
         and no transfer of a Global Note in whole or in part may be registered,
         in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global
         Note or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary (i) has notified
         the Bank that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for
         such Global Note or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered
         under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, at a time when
         the Depositary is required to be so registered to act as depositary, in
         each case unless the Bank has approved a successor Depositary


                                      20


<PAGE>





         within 90 days, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing an
         Event of Default with respect to such Global Note, (C) the Bank in its
         sole discretion determines that such Global Note will be so
         exchangeable or transferable or (D) there shall exist such
         circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as
         have been specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.

                  (3) Subject to Clause (2) above, any exchange of a Global Note
         for other Notes may be made in whole or in part, and all Notes issued
         in exchange for a Global Note or any portion thereof shall be
         registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Note shall
         direct.

                  (4) Every Note authenticated and delivered upon registration
         of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Note or any
         portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section or otherwise, shall
         be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global
         Note, unless such Note is registered in the name of a Person other than
         the Depositary for such Global Note or a nominee thereof.

         The Bank shall not be required (i) to issue, transfer or exchange any
Note during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day
of the mailing of a notice of redemption of Notes and ending at the close of
business on the day of such mailing or (ii) to transfer or exchange any Note so
to be redeemed.

SECTION 306.      MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN NOTES.

         If (i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or the Bank
and the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss
or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the Bank and the Trustee
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Bank or the Trustee that such
Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Bank shall execute and upon
its request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in
lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note of like
tenor and principal amount, having the identical original Issue Date, Stated
Maturity and provisions with respect to payment of Redemption Premium, if any,
and interest and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

         In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has become
or is about to become due and payable, the Bank in its discretion may, instead
of issuing a new Note, pay such Note.

         Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section, the Bank may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

         Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Bank, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen
Note shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to


                                      21


<PAGE>





all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all
other Notes duly issued hereunder.

         The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

Bank and the Trustee, or any agent of the foregoing, may treat the Person in
whose name any Note is registered as the owner of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of, Redemption Premium, if any, and (subject to
Section 309) interest on, such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever
whether or not such Note be overdue, and neither the Bank or the Trustee nor any
agent of the Bank or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 308.      CANCELLATION.

         All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, transfer or exchange
shall, if surrendered to the Bank or any agent of the Bank, be delivered to the
Trustee and, if not already cancelled, shall be promptly cancelled by it. The
Bank may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes
previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Bank may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly
cancelled by the Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in
exchange for any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section, except as
expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Notes held by the Trustee
shall be disposed of in accordance with the Trustee's policies and procedures in
effect at such time.

SECTION 309.      PAYMENT OF INTEREST; INTEREST RIGHTS PRESERVED.

         Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly
provided for, on the applicable Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
Person in whose name that Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered
at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest (unless
the Note or one or more Predecessor Notes is called for redemption on a date
which is prior to such Interest Payment Date, in which case interest shall be
paid thereon as provided in Article Thirteen), except that interest payable on
the Stated Maturity of a Note shall be paid to the Person to whom principal is
paid.

         Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not timely paid or
duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the registered Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue
of having been such Holder and the interest payment shall be made by the Bank,
at its election, in each case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

                  (1) The Bank may elect to pay such overdue amounts to the
         Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective Predecessor
         Notes) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date
         for the payment of such overdue amounts, which Special Record Date
         shall be fixed in the following manner. The Bank shall notify the
         Trustee in writing of the amount of overdue interest proposed to be
         paid on each Note


                                      22


<PAGE>





         and the date of the proposed payment (which shall be at least 30 days
         after the date of such notice), and at the same time the Bank shall
         deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate
         amount proposed to be paid in respect of such overdue amounts or shall
         make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to
         the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held
         in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto as in this
         paragraph provided; thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record
         Date for the payment of such overdue amounts, which Special Record Date
         shall be not more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of
         the proposed payment and not less than 15 days after the receipt by the
         Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
         promptly notify the Bank of such Special Record Date and, in the name
         and at the expense of the Bank, shall cause notice of the proposed
         payment of such overdue interest and the Special Record Date therefor
         to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, not less than 10 days prior
         to such Special Record Date, to each Holder at his address as it
         appears in the Note Register as of the date of such notice, and such
         overdue interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes
         (or their respective predecessor Notes) are registered as of the close
         of business on such Special Record Date.

                  (2) The Bank may make payment of any overdue interest in any
         other lawful manner if, after notice given by the Bank to the Trustee
         of the proposed payment, such manner of payment shall be deemed
         practicable by this Trustee.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such payment of overdue interest
shall affect the status of the failure to pay interest on any Interest Payment
Date as an Event of Default under Section 501.

         Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section each Note delivered
under this Indenture upon transfer or exchange for or in lieu of any other Note
shall carry the rights to accrued and unpaid interest which were carried by such
other Note.

SECTION 310.      COMPUTATION OF INTEREST.

         Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest
on the Notes for any period shall be computed on the basis of a 360- day year of
twelve 30-day months and, for any period less than a full calendar month, the
number of days elapsed in such month.

expressly provided for), and the Trustee, at the expense of the Bank, shall
execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture, and shall make arrangements with the FHLB of Atlanta for surrender of
the Letter of Credit, when

                  Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose an amount
                  sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on
                  such Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
                  cancellation, for principal and interest to the date of such
                  deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and
                  payable), or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the
                  case may be;

                  (2) the Bank has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
         payable hereunder by the Bank; and

         Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions
         precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and
         discharge of this Indenture have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the
obligations of the Bank to the Trustee under Section 607 shall survive.

SECTION 402.      APPLICATION OF TRUST MONEY.

         All money deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be
held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Notes
and this Indenture, to the payment to the Persons entitled thereto, of the

money has been deposited with the Trustee.

SECTION 502.      ACCELERATION OF MATURITY; RESCISSION AND ANNULMENT.

         If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then and in every such
case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Notes Outstanding may declare the principal of all the Notes to be due and
payable, by a notice in writing to the Bank (and to the Trustee if given by
Holders), and upon any such declaration, such principal and, in the case of
Designated Fixed Rate Notes, the Redemption Premium shall become due and payable
by mandatory redemption pursuant to Section 1301; provided, however, that if the
Letter of Credit, for any reason, is not in full force and effect, the Trustee
or the Holders may declare the principal of, and, in the case of Designated
Fixed Rate Notes, the Redemption Premium on, all the Notes to be due and payable
immediately; provided further, that if an Event of Default set forth in clause
(6) or (7) of Section 501 shall occur and a receiver, conservator, liquidator,
assignee,


                                      25


<PAGE>





trustee or sequestrator (or other similar official) shall be appointed in
respect of the Bank, no acceleration of maturity of the Notes or declaration
thereof shall occur pursuant to this Section 502 unless and until consistent
with the rights of such receiver or conservator (or similar official) under
applicable law; provided further, however, that the foregoing proviso shall not
apply if (i) any Event of Default other than those set forth in clauses (6) or
(7) shall have occurred and be continuing or (ii) the Notes are repudiated or
the maturity of the Notes is accelerated by a receiver or conservator (or other
similar official) or by a court.

         At any time after such a declaration of acceleration has been made and
before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by
the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Notes Outstanding, by written notice to the Bank and
the Trustee, or the Trustee if such declaration of acceleration has not been
made by the Holders of Notes, by written notice to the Bank, may rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if

                  (1)      the Bank has paid or deposited with the Trustee a
         sum sufficient to pay

                           (A) all overdue installments of interest on all
                  Notes,

                           (B) the principal of any Notes which have become due
                  otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration and
                  interest thereon at the respective rates borne by such Notes,

                           (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is
                  lawful, interest upon overdue installments of interest at the
                  respective rates borne by such Notes, and

                           (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee
                  hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses,
                  disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
                  counsel;

                  (2) all Events of Default, other than the non-payment of the
         principal of, or Redemption Premium, if any, on Notes which have become
         due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided
         in Section 513; and

                  (3) notice of redemption has not been given pursuant to
         Section 1303.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 503.      COLLECTION OF INDEBTEDNESS AND SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT
                  BY TRUSTEE.

         The Bank covenants that if

                  (1) default is made in the payment of any installment of
         interest on any Note when such interest becomes due and payable and
         such default continues for a period of more than two Business Days, or

                  (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of, or
         Redemption Premium, if any, on any Note at the Maturity thereof,


                                      26


<PAGE>





the Bank will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on such Notes for
principal, Redemption Premium, if any, and interest, with interest upon the
overdue principal and Redemption Premium, if any, and, to the extent that
payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, upon overdue installments
of interest, at the rates borne by the Notes; and, in addition thereto, such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

         If the Bank fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Bank or any other obligor upon the Notes and collect the moneys
adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the
property of the Bank or any other obligor upon the Notes, wherever situated.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the FHLB of Atlanta fails
to make payment under the Letter of Credit after a proper demand for payment has
been made by the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust,
the Trustee may institute a judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums
so due and unpaid, may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and
may enforce the same against the FHLB of Atlanta in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the FHLB of Atlanta.

         If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific
enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 504.      TRUSTEE MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM.

         In case of the pendency of any conservatorship or receivership or any
insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment,
composition or other similar proceeding relative to the Bank or any other
obligor upon the Notes or the property of the Bank or of such other obligor or
their creditors or relating to the FHLB of Atlanta, the Trustee (irrespective of
whether the principal or Redemption Premium, if any, of the Notes shall then be
due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made a demand on the Bank for the
payment of overdue principal, Redemption Premium, if any, or interest or shall
have made any drawing under the Letter of Credit) shall be entitled and
empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

                  (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of
         principal, Redemption Premium, if any, and interest owing and unpaid in
         respect of the Notes or for the Credit Amount of the Letter of Credit
         and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or
         advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any
         claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders
         allowed in such proceeding, and


                                      27


<PAGE>





                  (ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property
         payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
         and any conservator, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
         sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such proceeding is
         hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee
         and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such
         payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due
         to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
         advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts
         due the Trustee under Section 607.

         Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept, or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or
the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect
of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 505.      TRUSTEE MAY ENFORCE CLAIMS WITHOUT POSSESSION OF NOTES.

         All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Notes may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
Notes or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such
proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee
of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the
payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of
the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders
of the Notes in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

SECTION 506.      APPLICATION OF MONEY COLLECTED.

         Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article, other than
(i) any money received by the Trustee as a result of any demand for payment
under the Letter of Credit or (ii) any money held in trust for the benefit of
Holders of Notes, shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates
fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account
of principal, Redemption Premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the
Notes and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon
surrender thereof if fully paid:

         FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
607;

         SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for interest
on the Notes in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been
collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the
amounts due and payable on such Notes for interest;

         THIRD: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal
and Redemption Premium, if any, on the Notes in respect of which or for the
benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such Notes for
principal and Redemption Premium, if any; and

         FOURTH: The balance, if any, to the Bank.

SECTION 507.      LIMITATION ON SUITS.

         No Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any proceeding,
judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of
a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless

                  (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to a
         Responsible Officer of the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default;

                  (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of
         the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee to
         institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own
         name as Trustee hereunder;

                  (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee
         reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
         incurred in compliance with such request;

                  (4) the Trustee for 30 days after its receipt of such notice,
         request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
         proceeding;

                  (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has
         been given to the Trustee during such 30-day period by the Holders of a
         majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes; and

                  (6) such Event of Default is continuing;

it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Notes shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other
Holders of Notes, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over
any other Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the
manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all the Holders
of Notes.

SECTION 508.      UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT OF HOLDERS TO RECEIVE PRINCIPAL
                  AND INTEREST.

         Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Note shall have the right which is absolute and unconditional to receive
payment of the principal of, and (subject to Section 309) interest on, such Note
on the Stated Maturity expressed in such Note (or, in the case of redemption,
principal of, Redemption Premium, if any, and (subject to Section 309) interest
on such Note on the Redemption Date fixed for such Note) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not be impaired
without the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 509.      RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.

         If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce
any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to
the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case the Bank, the Trustee
and the Holders shall, subject to any determination in such proceeding, be
restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder, and
thereafter all rights


                                      29


<PAGE>





and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 510.      RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or
to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and
every right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and
in addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 511.      DELAY OR OMISSION NOT WAIVER.

         No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder to exercise any
right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right
or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee
or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

SECTION 512.      CONTROL BY HOLDERS.

         The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee, provided that

                  (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
         law or with this Indenture, and

                  (2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
         Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

SECTION 513.      WAIVER OF PAST DEFAULTS.

         The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes may, at any time prior to the giving of notice of redemption
pursuant to Section 1303, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any
past default hereunder and its consequences, except a default

                  (1) in the payment of the principal of, Redemption Premium,
         if any, or interest on any Note, or

                  (2) of the type specified in Section 501(3), or

                  (3) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under
         Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
         Holder of each Outstanding Note affected.


                                      30


<PAGE>





         Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 514.      UNDERTAKING FOR COSTS.

         All parties to this Indenture agree, and each Holder of any Note by his
acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or
omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in its
discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and
good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the
provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in
the aggregate more than 10% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, or to
any suit instituted by any Holder for the enforcement of the payment of the
principal of or interest on any Note on or after the Stated Maturity expressed
in such Note (or, in the case of redemption, principal of, Redemption Premium,
if any, or interest on or after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 515.      WAIVER OF USURY, STAY OR EXTENSION LAWS.

         The Bank covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any usury, stay or extension law wherever
enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this Indenture; and the Bank (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such
law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

SECTION 516.      CALCULATION OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT

         The Bank shall file with the Trustee promptly at the end of each
calendar year (i) a written notice specifying the amount of original issue
discount accrued on Notes Outstanding as of the end of such year and (ii) such
other specific information relating such original issue discount as may then be
relevant under the Code.

                                   THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 601.      CERTAIN DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

         (a)  Except during the continuance of an Event of Default,

                  (1) the Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only
         such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no
         implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture
         against the Trustee;

                  (2) in the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
         conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
         correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or
         opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of
         this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions
         which by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished
         to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same
         to determine whether or not on their face they conform to the
         requirements of this Indenture; and

         (b) In case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a
prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs.

         (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that

                  (1) this Subsection shall not be construed to limit the effect
         of Subsection (a) of this Section;

                  (2) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment
         made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved
         that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

                  (3) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
         taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
         direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
         Outstanding Notes relating to the time, method and place of conducting
         any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
         any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

         (d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend
or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is
not reasonably assured to it.


                                      32


<PAGE>





         (e) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of
this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this
Section.

SECTION 602.      NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.

         Within 60 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder, the
Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Holders, as their names and addresses
appear in the Note Register, notice of such default hereunder actually known to
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such default shall have been cured
or waived; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of a default in the
payment of the principal of, Redemption Premium, if any, or interest on any Note
or an Event of Default of the type specified in Section 501(3), the Trustee
shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of
directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors and/or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding
of such notice is in the interests of the Holders; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
in the case of any default of the character specified in Section 501(5), no such
notice to Holders shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence
thereof. For the purpose of this Section, the term "DEFAULT" means any event
which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of
Default.

SECTION 603.      CERTAIN RIGHTS OF TRUSTEE.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 601:

         (a) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be protected in acting
or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,

debenture or other paper or document reasonably believed by it to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

         (b) any request or direction of the Bank mentioned herein shall be
sufficiently evidenced by a Bank Request or Bank Order and any resolution of the
Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a Board Resolution;

         (c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall

be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part,
conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

         (d) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the
advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

         (e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of
any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Holders shall have
offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such
request or direction;


                                      33


<PAGE>





         (f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into facts
or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture or
other paper or document but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such
further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit,
and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and premises
of the Bank, personally or by agent or attorney; and

         (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or
attorneys and the Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or
negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it
hereunder.

SECTION 604.      NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF NOTES.

         The recitals contained herein and in the Notes, except the Trustee's
certificate of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Bank, and
the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent assumes no responsibility for their
correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Notes. The Trustee represents that it is
duly authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture and to perform its duties
hereunder. The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall not be accountable for
the use or application by the Bank of Notes or the proceeds thereof.

SECTION 605.      MAY HOLD NOTES.

         The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent the Note
Registrar and any other agent of the Bank or the Trustee, in its individual or
any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of, or may hold or acquire
other rights in, Notes and may otherwise deal with the Bank with the same rights
it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Note
Registrar or such agent.

SECTION 606.      MONEY HELD IN TRUST.

         Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated
from other trust funds except to the extent required by law or by the express
provisions hereof. The Trustee shall not be under any liability for interest on
any money received by it hereunder except as provided herein or otherwise agreed
with the Bank.

SECTION 607.      COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT.

         The Bank agrees

                  (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation
         as agreed upon from time to time in writing for all services rendered
         by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be limited by any
         provisions of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an
         express trust);

                  (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to
         reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all expenses, disbursements

                                      34


<PAGE>





         in accordance with any provisions of this Indenture (including the
         reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its
         agents and counsel), except any such expense, disbursement or advance
         as may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

                  (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless
         against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or
         willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with
         the acceptance or administration of this trust, including the costs and
         expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in
         connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or
         duties hereunder.

         The FHLB of Atlanta shall have no liability to the Trustee with respect
to any sums payable to the Trustee under this Section 607 or otherwise
hereunder.

         The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this
Indenture.

SECTION 608.      CORPORATE TRUSTEE REQUIRED; ELIGIBILITY.

         There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a
corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of
America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such
laws to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus
of at least $50,000,000 subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
state authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital
and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at
any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 609.      RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR.

         (a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until (i) the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee under Section 610, (ii) a
Substitute Letter of Credit has been issued by the FHLB of Atlanta to the
successor Trustee conforming to the requirements of Section 1104 and (iii) the
successor Trustee has established a Note Account.

         (b) The Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to the Bank. If the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Section shall not have
been satisfied within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation or
removal, the resigning or removed Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time by Act of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, delivered to the Trustee
and to the Bank.

         (d) If at any time:


                                      35


<PAGE>





                  (1) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 608
         and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Bank or
         by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least
         six months, or

                  (2) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
         adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
         property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
         control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
         rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Bank by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide
Holder of a Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, the
Bank, by a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. If,
within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the
occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes delivered to
the Bank and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall,
forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment, become the successor Trustee
and supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Bank. If no successor
Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Bank or the Holders and accepted
appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder who has been a bona
fide Holder of a Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

         (f) The Bank shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of
the Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee by mailing written
notice of such event by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the Holders of
Notes at their addresses as shown in the Note Register. Each notice shall
include the name of the successor Trustee and the address of its Corporate Trust
Office.

SECTION 610.      ACCEPTANCE OF APPOINTMENT BY SUCCESSOR.

         Every successor Trustee appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Bank and the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment, and, subject to Section 609, the resignation or removal of the
retiring Trustee shall thereupon become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on request of
the Bank or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of
its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its lien,
if any, provided for in Section 607. Upon request of any such successor Trustee,
the Bank and the FHLB of Atlanta shall execute any and all instruments
reasonably determined by such parties to be necessary for more fully and
certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights,
powers and trusts.


                                      36


<PAGE>





         No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article.

SECTION 611.      MERGER OR CONSOLIDATION.

         Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust
business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this
Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the
part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Notes shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with the same effect
as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Notes.

SECTION 612.      APPOINTMENT OF AUTHENTICATING AGENT.

         As of the date of this Indenture and at any time when any of the Notes
remain Outstanding, the Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or
Authenticating Agents with respect to any Notes which the Authenticating Agent
or Authenticating Agents shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
authenticate, and Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of
this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if
authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this
Indenture to the completion, authentication and delivery of Notes by the Trustee
or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be deemed
to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.

         Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Bank and shall at
all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the
United States of America or of any State, authorized under such laws to act as
Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than
$50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State
Authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. In
case at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall
resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

         Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be
Authenticating Agent without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.


                                      37


<PAGE>





         An Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by providing no less
than 120 days advance written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the
Bank, unless the Bank agrees in writing to a shorter notice period, such
resignation not to become effective prior to the date of appointment of a
successor Authenticating Agent. The Bank or the Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of
termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Bank. Upon receiving such a
notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent which shall be acceptable to the Bank and shall mail notice of such
appointment to all Holders of Notes with respect to which such Authenticating
Agent will serve, as their names and addresses appear on the Note Register. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent
herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible
under the provisions of this Section.

         The Bank agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.

         If an appointment is made pursuant to this Section, the Notes may have
endorsed thereon, in addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an
alternate certificate of authentication in the following form:

         This is one of the Notes referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

                      HOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY TRUSTEE

SECTION 701.      BANK TO FURNISH NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF HOLDERS.

         The Bank will furnish or cause to be furnished by the Note Registrar to
the Trustee on a semi-annual basis, on each Regular Record Date for the Notes,
and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing, within 30 days
after receipt by the Bank of any such request, a list in such form as the
Trustee may reasonably require containing all the information in the possession
or control of the Bank as to the names and addresses of the Holders, obtained
since the date as of which the next previous list, if any, was furnished;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such list need be furnished so long as the Trustee is
the Note Registrar. Any such list may be dated as of a date not more than 15
days prior to the time such information is furnished or caused to be furnished
and need not include information received after such date.

SECTION 702.      PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION; COMMUNICATIONS TO HOLDERS.

         (a) The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form as reasonably
practicable, all information (i) as to the names and addresses of Holders
contained in the most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 701,
and (ii) received by it in the capacity of Note Registrar hereunder.

         The Trustee may (i) destroy any list furnished to it as provided in
Section 701 upon receipt of a new list so furnished, (ii) destroy any
information received by it as Note Registrar hereunder upon delivering to itself
as Trustee, not earlier than 45 days after an Interest Payment Date, a list
containing the names and addresses of the Holders obtained from such information
since the delivery of the next previous list, if any, and (iii) destroy any list
delivered to itself as Trustee which was compiled from information received by
it as Note Registrar hereunder upon the receipt of a new list so delivered.

         (b) If three or more Holders (hereinafter referred to as "applicants")
apply in writing to the Trustee, and furnish to the Trustee reasonable proof
that each such applicant has owned a Note for a period of at least six months
preceding the date of such application, and such application states that the
applicants desire to communicate with other Holders with respect to their rights

                  (ii) inform such applicants as to the approximate number of
         Holders whose names and addresses appear in the information preserved

increase in the Credit Amount or an extension or renewal of the expiration date
of the Letter of Credit, must be consented to by the Trustee in writing.

         Upon application by the Bank to the FHLB of Atlanta, and subject to the
FHLB of Atlanta's regulations and credit guidelines, the expiration date of the
Letter of Credit may be extended and the Letter of Credit may be renewed from
time to time, by a Certificate of Renewal issued by the FHLB of Atlanta to the
Trustee in the form of Exhibit F to the Letter of Credit, which shall be
effective upon receipt by the Trustee. Any expiration date established by any
Certificate of Renewal shall be a Business Day and shall not be earlier than the
then existing expiration date of the Letter of Credit nor later than the date
which is ten years from the effective date of such Certificate of Renewal or
such later date as the FHLB of Atlanta may agree to.

         The Credit Amount may be increased from time to time or, as the same
may be reduced by a drawing upon the Letter of Credit, may be reinstated by a
Certificate Increasing the Credit Amount or a Certificate Reinstating the Credit
Amount in the form of Exhibits E or C, respectively, to the Letter of Credit
which shall be effective upon receipt by the Trustee.

         In addition, the Bank may, subject to the provisions of this Section,
reduce the Credit Amount of the Letter of Credit from time to time by
presentation to the Trustee of a Reduction Certificate. Upon receipt by the
Trustee of a Reduction Certificate, the Bank shall determine the Note Face
Value, which calculation shall be confirmed by the Trustee. If the Credit
Amount, after giving effect to the Reduction Certificate, shall be equal to or
greater than the Note Face Value of the Notes Outstanding as verified by the
Trustee, the Trustee shall consent to such Reduction Certificate as provided
thereon and shall present such Certificate to the FHLB of Atlanta.

SECTION 1104.     SUBSTITUTE LETTER OF CREDIT.

         At the direction of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Letter of Credit may be
replaced with a Substitute Letter of Credit provided that:

<PAGE>





                  (1) The FHLB of Atlanta certifies that its direction to
         replace the Letter of Credit and the Substitute Letter of Credit are in
         compliance with and pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement;

                  (2) such Substitute Letter of Credit:

                           (a) is in the form of Exhibit A hereto;

                           (b) is irrevocable;

                           (c) is issued by the FHLB of Atlanta to the Trustee
                  as the beneficiary thereof for the benefit of Holders of the
                  Notes;

                           (d) has a Credit Amount at least equal to the Note
                  Face Value of the Notes Outstanding;

                           (e) has an expiration date which is no earlier than
                  the latest Stated Maturity of any Note Outstanding plus two
                  Business Days or such later date as the FHLB of Atlanta may
                  agree to and an effective date which is no later than the date
                  of replacement;

                           (f) is otherwise identical to the outstanding Letter
                  of Credit; and

                  (3) the Trustee receives written confirmation from Moody's and
         S&P (in each case, if then in the business of rating securities such as
         the Notes) that replacement of the Letter of Credit with such
         Substitute Letter of Credit will not, in and of itself, reduce or
         result in the withdrawal of any rating on the Notes then in effect.

SECTION 1105.     INSPECTION OF DOCUMENTS BY HOLDERS OF NOTES.

         The Trustee shall keep fully executed or conformed copies of this
Indenture, the Letter of Credit and the Reimbursement Agreement (together with
all amendments, modifications, supplements, waivers and consents made or given
with respect hereto and thereto) on file at its Corporate Trust Office and shall
provide to the Holder of any Note or by an officer, employee or agent of such
Holder, provided that the person purporting to be such Holder establishes to the
satisfaction of the Trustee he is in fact such Holder and, in cases where
inspection is sought to be made by a person purporting to be an officer,
employee or agent of such Holder, that such person submits evidence satisfactory
to the Trustee of his authority to make inspection on behalf of such Holder. The
Bank shall promptly advise the Trustee of any amendment, modification, waiver or
consent made or given with respect to the Reimbursement Agreement, and promptly
after the effectiveness thereof, shall furnish a fully executed or conformed
copy of such amendment, modification, waiver or consent to the Trustee.

                                PAYMENT OF NOTES

SECTION 1201.     ESTABLISHMENT OF NOTE ACCOUNT.

         At the time of the execution and delivery of this Indenture, and for
the purposes of this Indenture, the Trustee shall establish a special purpose
trust account for the benefit of Holders of Notes to be referred to herein as
the "Note Account" and over which the Trustee shall have exclusive control and
the sole right of withdrawal. Any and all funds at any time on deposit in, or
otherwise to the credit of, the Note Account shall be held in trust by the
Trustee for the benefit of Holders of Notes. Except as provided in Section 1203
hereof, the only permitted withdrawal from or application of funds on deposit
in, or otherwise to the credit of, the Note Account shall be to pay the interest
on and principal of the Notes in accordance with their terms and the provisions
of this Indenture. The Trustee agrees to give the Bank and the FHLB of Atlanta
immediate notice if the Note Account or any funds on deposit in, or otherwise to
the credit of, the Note Account shall become subject to any writ, order,
judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process. Neither the Bank
nor the FHLB of Atlanta shall have any legal, equitable or beneficial interest
in the Note Account.

SECTION 1202.     PAYMENT OF NOTES; DRAWS UPON THE LETTER OF CREDIT.

         (a) The Trustee agrees that, to the extent sufficient funds are
available in the Note Account or are available subject to a drawing under the
Letter of Credit, the Trustee shall, subject to Section 1003, make payment from
such available funds of interest on and principal of the Notes as herein
provided.

         (b) By 10:00 a.m. (Atlanta, Georgia time) on the third Business Day
before each Payment Date, the Bank shall remit to the Trustee in immediately
available funds for deposit in the Note Account the amount payable on the Notes
on such Payment Date. Each such date on which the Bank is required to remit
funds to the Trustee for deposit in the Note Account is hereinafter referred to
as a "Note Account Deposit Date."

         (c) As promptly as may be practicable on each Note Account Deposit
Date, the Trustee shall determine whether sufficient immediately available funds
are then on deposit in the Note Account (for purposes hereof, funds shall not be
considered immediately available to the extent they are subject to any writ,
order, judgment, warrant of attachment, execution or similar process) to enable
the Trustee to pay when due the interest and Redemption Premium, if any, on, and
principal of, each Note due on the next succeeding Payment Date. If, at such
time, the immediately available funds then on deposit in the Note Account are
insufficient to pay all of such interest, Redemption Premium, if any, and
principal in full when due, then the Trustee shall promptly notify the Bank by
telephone, and, if the Trustee has not received from the Bank by 3:15 p.m.
(Atlanta, Georgia time) on such Note Account Deposit Date, sufficient
immediately available funds to pay all the interest, Redemption Premium, if any,
and principal due on the Notes on the next succeeding Payment Date, then on the
Business Day immediately following such Note Account Deposit Date, the Trustee
shall, no later than 4:45 p.m. (Atlanta, Georgia time), make a demand for
payment in accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit in an


                                      50


<PAGE>





amount equal to the amount due on the Notes on such Payment Date less the amount
of immediately available funds then on deposit in the Note Account. Pursuant to
the Letter of Credit, if the FHLB of Atlanta receives a conforming drawing
certificate not later than 4:45 P.M., Atlanta, Georgia time, it will on the
second Business Day thereafter make available to the Trustee immediately
available funds in the amount of the drawing not later than 10:00 A.M., Atlanta,
Georgia time. If the FHLB of Atlanta receives a conforming drawing certificate
after 4:45 P.M., Atlanta, Georgia time, such drawing shall be deemed to have
been received on the next succeeding Business Day. If the Trustee receives
notice from the FHLB of Atlanta that a demand for payment under the Letter of
Credit is non-conforming, the Trustee will take prompt steps to submit to the
FHLB of Atlanta a conforming demand. The Trustee, to the extent that it has
taken all steps required hereunder and pursuant to the Letter of Credit to
present to the FHLB of Atlanta a conforming drawing certificate on a timely
basis, shall not be liable for the failure of the FHLB of Atlanta to make a
disbursement of the proceeds of such Letter of Credit to the Trustee.

         (d) Any funds received by the Trustee as a result of any drawing or
demand for payment under the Letter of Credit shall be applied by the Trustee,
subject to Section 1003, together with the funds, if any, to be withdrawn from
the Note Account, directly to the payment in full of the interest, Redemption
Premium, if any, and principal payments due on the Notes (including Notes held
for the Trustee's own account). Funds received by the Trustee as a result of any
drawing or demand for payment under the Letter of Credit shall be held by the
Trustee until disbursed to Holders of Notes in a separate trust account
established for this purpose for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, and shall
not be deposited in the Note Account or applied or used for any other purpose
whatsoever.

SECTION 1203.     INVESTMENT OF FUNDS IN THE NOTE ACCOUNT.

         Any immediately available funds remitted by the Bank to the Trustee for
deposit in the Note Account in accordance with Section 1202(b) hereof shall,
between the date such funds are remitted to the Trustee and the next succeeding
Payment Date, be invested by the Trustee at the written direction of the Bank in
the following permitted investments ("Permitted Investments"): (i) direct
obligations of the United States, (ii) repurchase agreements with respect to
such direct obligations with the lead bank (which may include the Trustee if the
Trustee so qualifies) of a bank holding company the senior debt of which has a
rating of at least "Aaa" from Moody's and "AAA" by S&P, or (iii) such other
investments as may be acceptable to the rating agency or agencies rating the
Notes, such acceptability to be evidenced in writing, which would not result in
a reduction or withdrawal of the rating on the Notes by any such rating agency
or agencies; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such Permitted Investments shall mature or
be redeemable at par at the option of the holder within such periods as to
permit timely payments in respect of the Notes. If as a result of any investment
by the Trustee in Permitted Investments listed above, there shall be
insufficient immediately available funds in the Note Account to pay when due the
interest and Redemption Premium, if any, on, and principal of, the Notes with
respect to which the funds were deposited by the Bank, the Trustee shall
promptly and in any event prior to or on the Payment Date of such payments
notify the Bank of such deficiency and the Bank shall deposit additional funds
for the payment of Notes in the amount of such insufficiency prior to or at the
opening of business on the earlier of (i) the following Business Day and (ii)
the Payment Date of such payments. Any funds remaining in the Note Account on
any Payment Date after payment in


                                      51


<PAGE>





full of all amounts of interest, Redemption Premium, if any, and principal due
on the Notes on such Payment Date shall belong to the Bank and be returned to
the Bank at its written direction; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such withdrawal
will be permitted if as a result thereof the Note Face Value of the Notes
Outstanding would exceed the Credit Amount. Subject to Section 601, the Trustee
shall have no liability for losses to the Note Account caused by investments
made according to the terms of this Section 1203. Interest shall not accrue on
uninvested funds.

SECTION 1204.     NOTE ACCOUNT STATEMENTS.

         The Trustee shall give the Bank a monthly statement reflecting all
deposits to and withdrawals from the Note Account since the date of the last
statement furnished pursuant to this Section.


                                ARTICLE THIRTEEN

SECTION 1301.     MANDATORY REDEMPTION.

         (a) The Notes may not be redeemed at the option of the Bank prior to
the Stated Maturity of the Notes.

         (b) However, the Notes are subject to mandatory redemption, and the
Trustee shall call for redemption all Notes Outstanding, upon the occurrence of
any of the following events:

                  (1) if any payment of principal of or interest on any Note has
         been made with funds drawn under the Letter of Credit and the Trustee
         does not receive from the FHLB of Atlanta a Certificate Reinstating the
         Credit Amount (in the form described in Section 1103 hereof)
         reinstating the Credit Amount in full by the close of business of the
         fifth Business Day after the date the Trustee submitted a drawing
         certificate under the Letter of Credit;

                  (2) if an Event of Default specified in clauses (1), (2) or
         (3) of Section 501 shall have occurred; or

                  (3) if an Event of Default other than those specified in
         clauses (1), (2) and (3) of Section 501 shall have occurred and a
         declaration of acceleration has been made pursuant to Section 502 and
         such declaration of acceleration has not been rescinded prior to the
         giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Notes are not subject to redemption
upon the occurrence of an event specified in clause (b)(1) of this Section or an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) of Section 501 if (i) the Trustee
receives from the FHLB of Atlanta a Certificate Reinstating the Credit Amount
reinstating the Credit Amount in full prior to the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee and (ii) no other Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing.

on any date, and shall be at a Redemption Price equal to the principal amount of
the Notes plus interest accrued thereon to the Redemption Date plus, in the case
of Designated Fixed Rate Notes only, the Redemption Premium for such Notes.
There shall be no Redemption Premium in respect of Notes that bear a floating

         the Redemption Date shall be a Business Day not more than ten (10) days
         after the end of the period of five Business Days allotted for receipt
         by the Trustee of the Certificate Reinstating the Credit Amount; and

                  (2) In the case of redemption pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of
         Section 1301(b), the Redemption Date shall be a Business Day not more
         than ten (10) days after the occurrence of the Event of Default or the
         declaration of acceleration, as the case may be.

SECTION 1303.     NOTICE OF REDEMPTION.

         Notice of redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, mailed not less than six (6) days prior to the Redemption Date, to each
Holder of Notes to be redeemed, at his last address appearing in the Note
Register on the record date for the giving of such notice of redemption (the
"Redemption Record Date"). The Redemption Record Date shall be as set by the
Trustee. In addition, in the case of Designated Fixed Rate Notes, notice of
redemption shall also be given by facsimile to the Quotation Agent for receipt
by such Quotation Agent no later than six (6) days prior to the Redemption Date.

         All notices of redemption shall state:

                  (3) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will
         become due and payable upon each Note, and that interest thereon shall
         cease to accrue on and after said date, and

                  (4) the place or places where the Notes are to be surrendered
         for payment of the Redemption Price, which shall include the office or
         agency of the Bank maintained in accordance with Section 1002.

         Notice of redemption of Notes shall be given by the Trustee in the name
of and at the expense of the Bank.

SECTION 1304.     DEPOSIT OF REDEMPTION PRICE.

         In accordance with Section 1202(b), the Bank shall remit to the Trustee
an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Notes on the
Note Account Deposit Date prior to the Redemption Date.

SECTION 1305.     NOTES PAYABLE ON REDEMPTION DATE.

         Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Notes shall,
on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price therein
specified and on and after such date (unless the Bank shall default in the
payment of the Redemption Price) the Notes shall cease to bear interest. Upon
surrender of any such Note for redemption in accordance with said notice, such
Note shall be paid by the Bank at the Redemption Price in accordance with the
terms thereof and of the Indenture.

         If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption and if funds for all amounts payable upon such redemption
shall not be on deposit with the Trustee, the principal, and Redemption Premium,
if applicable (and, to the extent that interest thereon shall be legally
enforceable, the interest), shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption
Date at the rate borne by the Note.

detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, have requested the
Trustee to call a meeting of Holders to take any action authorized to be taken
under Section 1401 and the Trustee shall not have given notice of such meeting
within 20 days after receipt of such request, then the Bank or the Holders of
Notes in the amount above specified may determine the time and the place for

constitute a quorum, but, if less than a quorum be present, the Persons holding
or representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
represented at the meeting may adjourn such meeting with the same effect, for
all interests and purposes, as though a quorum had been present, and the meeting
may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

of Holders duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all
Holders, whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record in duplicate of the
proceedings of each meeting of Holders shall be prepared by the permanent

one of the duplicates shall be delivered to the Bank and the other to the
Trustee to be preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto or

or conveyance, become vested with all the authority, rights, powers, trusts,
immunities, duties and obligations of Calculation Agent, and with like effect as
if originally named as Calculation Agent hereunder and the Trustee shall

      BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"), a federal savings bank, for value received,
hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum
of _____________________________________________________________ United States
Dollars on the Maturity Date shown above, and to pay interest thereon at the
rate per annum shown above until the principal hereof is paid or duly made
available for payment. The Bank will pay interest semi-annually on each ________
_______and ______________________ (herein called an "Interest Payment Date"), 
commencing with the first Interest Payment Date following the Original Issue
Date shown above, and on the Maturity Date shown above; provided, however, that
if the Original Issue Date shown above is between a Regular Record Date (as
defined herein) and an Interest Payment Date, interest payments will commence on
the Interest Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date.
Interest on this Note will accrue from the most recent Interest Payment Date to
which interest has been paid or fully provided for or, if no interest has been
paid on this Note, from the Original Issue Date shown above until the principal
hereof has been paid or duly provided for or made available for payment in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture. The amount of interest payable on
any Interest Payment Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain exceptions
provided in the Indenture be paid only to the Person in whose name this Note (or
one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the
Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date. The "Regular Record Date"
shall be the date which is 15 calendar days prior to the related Interest
Payment Date, whether or not such date shall be a Business Day; provided,
however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date shown above or upon
redemption will be payable to the Person to whom the principal hereof shall be
payable. Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly
provided for on any Interest Payment Date, shall forthwith cease to be payable
to the registered Holder on such Regular Record Date, and shall be paid to the
Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered
at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
overdue interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given to
the Holder of this Note not less than ten days prior to such Special Record
Date, or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully
provided in the Indenture.

      Payments of principal, the Redemption Premium, if any, and interest on
this Note shall be made in such coin or currency of the United States of America
as at the time of payment is legal tender for the payment of public and private
debts. Payments of interest on this Note (other than on the Maturity Date or
upon earlier redemption or repayment) will be made by wire transfer to such
account as has been appropriately designated to the Paying Agent (as defined
herein) by the person entitled to such payments.

      If any Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption
falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the required payment of principal,
Redemption Premium, if any, and/or interest shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment
was due, and no interest shall accrue with respect to such payment for the
period from and after such Interest Payment Date, the Maturity Date or date of
earlier redemption, as the case may be, to the date of such payment on the next
succeeding Business Day.

at maturity or redemption will be paid upon maturity or redemption in
immediately available funds against presentation of this Note at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee, as paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in New York,
New York (as of the date of this Note, such office being located at 101 Barclay

under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

      This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Senior Notes (herein called
the "Notes") of the Bank, issued and to be issued under an Indenture dated as of
November 4, 1998 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Bank and the Bank
of New York, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture) to which the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta (herein called the "FHLB of Atlanta"), has joined as a consenting party,
to which Indenture and all Indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby
made for a statement of the respective rights, duties and obligations thereunder
of the Bank, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes and the terms upon which
the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes may bear
different dates, mature at different times and bear interest at different fixed
or floating rates and differ in such other respects as may be provided pursuant
to the terms of the Indenture.

      Payment of the principal of, Redemption Premium, if any, and interest on,
this Note is supported by an irrevocable standby letter of credit (herein called
the "Letter of Credit") issued to the Trustee by the FHLB of Atlanta pursuant to
a certain Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement (herein called the
"Reimbursement Agreement") between the Bank and the FHLB of Atlanta.

      Copies of the Indenture, the Letter of Credit, the Reimbursement Agreement
and other related credit documents are on file with the Trustee at its Corporate
Trust Office and are available for inspection at such office. Reference is made
to those documents for the terms upon which the Letter of Credit has been
issued, the liability of the FHLB of Atlanta under the Letter of Credit with
respect to payment of this Note and the procedure governing demands for payment
under the Letter of Credit by the Trustee.

      This Note is subject to mandatory redemption in whole, but not in part, at
any time, at the Redemption Price (as defined below) in the event that a demand
under the Letter of Credit has been made for a payment of principal of or
interest on this Note or any Note issued pursuant to the Indenture and the
Trustee fails to receive notice from the FHLB of Atlanta within five Business
Days thereafter (I.E., within five Business Days after submission to the FHLB of
Atlanta by the Trustee of a drawing certificate under the Letter of Credit) that
the Credit Amount of the Letter of Credit has been reinstated or (ii) upon the
occurrence of certain Events of Default, or upon the declaration of acceleration
of the principal, and Redemption Premium, if any, of all the Notes following the
occurrence of certain other Events of Default, all in accordance with the
provisions of the Indenture. In the event this Note shall be called for
redemption, notice thereof shall be given by the Trustee by mailing a copy of
the redemption notice to the Holder hereof at the address shown in the Note
Register and, if a Quotation Agent is named on the face hereof, to the Quotation
Agent in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. If notice of
redemption shall have been duly given, and funds for the payment of Interest to
the Redemption Date shall be on deposit with the Trustee on such Redemption
Date, this Note shall cease to bear interest on the Redemption Date.

      The "Redemption Price" means the sum of (i) the principal amount hereof,
(ii) if specified on the face hereof, the Redemption Premium, if any, plus (iii)
accrued interest to the


                                       6
<PAGE>

Redemption Date; provided, however, that if a Redemption Premium is payable in
respect of this Note, the Redemption Price shall not exceed the applicable
Scheduled Maximum Redemption Price set forth on the face hereof plus accrued
interest to the Redemption Date. There shall be no Redemption Premium payable in
respect of this Note unless so specified on the face hereof.

      "Redemption Premium" means the amount equal to the present value, as
determined by the Quotation Agent, of the scheduled payments of interest hereon
from the Redemption Date to but excluding the Maturity Date shown on the face
hereof, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Adjusted Treasury Rate.

      "Adjusted Treasury Rate" means the sum of (i) the rate per annum equal to
the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue,
assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of
its principal amount) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Redemption
Date, plus (ii) the Adjusted Treasury Rate Spread, if and as specified on the
face hereof.

      "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security
selected by the Quotation Agent as having comparable scheduled payments of
interest to this Note from the Redemption Date to the Maturity Date that would
be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial
practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable
maturity to the remaining term of this Note.

      "Quotation  Agent"  means  the  Quotation  Agent  specified  on the face
hereof, and its successors.

      "Reference Treasury Dealers" means: (i) Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, PaineWebber Incorporated and Prudential Securities Incorporated and
their respective successors; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any of the foregoing
shall cease to be a Primary Treasury Dealer, the Quotation Agent shall
substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) two other Primary
Treasury Dealers selected by the Quotation Agent.

      "Comparable Treasury Price" means, with respect to the Redemption Date for
a Fixed Rate Note, the average of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for

      Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, this Note is not redeemable
prior to the Maturity Date shown on the face hereof or otherwise subject to
prepayment; provided, however, that if an Event of Default, as defined in the

Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding
on behalf of the Holders of all Notes to waive compliance by the Bank with
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued
upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu
hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

      No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Bank, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, Redemption Premium, if any,
and interest on this Note at the time, place and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed.

      As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein

York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form satisfactory to the Bank and the Note Registrar, duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one
or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate
principal amount, having the identical Original Issue Date, Maturity Date and
provisions with respect to payment of interest, will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees.

      Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Bank and the Trustee, and any agent of the Bank and the Trustee, may treat the
Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Bank or the
Trustee, nor any such agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

      The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form in minimum
denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

      Beneficial interests represented by this Note are exchangeable for
definitive Notes in registered form, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate
principal amount, only if (x) The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary (the
"Depositary") notifies the Bank that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a
clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Bank within 90 days,
(y) there shall 


                                       8

have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to this Note,
or (z) the Bank in its sole discretion determines that this Note will be so
exchangeable. Any Note representing such beneficial interests that is
exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable in whole
for definitive Notes in registered form, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate
principal amount, in minimum denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Such definitive Notes shall be registered in the name
or names of such person or persons as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.

      No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Bank may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

      All terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture shall have
the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

      BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"), for value received, hereby promises to pay
to CEDE & CO., or registered assigns, the principal sum of _____________________
United States Dollars on the Maturity Date shown above, and to pay interest
thereon, at a rate per annum equal to the Initial Interest Rate shown above
until the first Interest Reset Date shown above following the Original Issue
Date shown above and thereafter at a rate determined in accordance with the
provisions on the reverse hereof under the heading or headings "Determination of
CMT Rate," "Determination of Commercial Paper Rate," "Determination of Eleventh
District Cost of Funds Rate," "Determination of Federal Funds Rate,"
"Determination of LIBOR," "Determination of Prime Rate," or "Determination of
Treasury Rate," depending upon the Interest Rate Basis shown on the face hereof,
until the principal hereof is paid or duly made available for payment.

      The Bank will pay interest monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually
as shown above under "Interest Payment Period," on each Interest Payment Date
shown above, commencing with the first Interest Payment Date shown above next
succeeding the Original Issue Date shown above, and on the Maturity Date shown
above; provided, however, that if the Original Issue Date is between a Regular
Record Date (as hereinafter defined) and an Interest Payment Date, interest
payments will commence on the Interest Payment Date following the next
succeeding Regular Record Date, and provided further, that if an Interest
Payment Date would fall on a day that is not a Business Day (as defined on the
reverse hereof), such Interest Payment Date shall be the following day that is a
Business Day, except that in the case the Interest Rate Basis is LIBOR, as
indicated above, if such next Business Day falls in the next calendar month,
such Interest Payment Date shall be the next preceding day that is a Business
Day. Except as provided above and in the Indenture, interest payments will be
made on the Interest Payment Dates shown above. The "Regular Record Date" shall
be the date 15 calendar days prior to such Interest Payment Date, whether or not
such date shall be a Business Day. Interest on this Note will accrue from the
most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly
provided for. The interest payment on the Maturity Date will include interest
accrued to and excluding such Maturity Date, or, if no interest has been paid on
this Note, from the Original Issue Date, until the principal hereof has been
paid or made available for payment. The interest so payable, and punctually paid
or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, subject to certain
exceptions provided in the Indenture, be paid only to the Person in whose name
this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date; provided,
however, that interest payable on the Maturity Date shown above or upon
redemption will be payable to the Person to whom the principal hereof shall be
payable. Any such interest which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall forthwith cease to be payable
to the registered Holder hereof on such Regular Record Date, and shall be paid
to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of
such overdue interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice of which shall be given
to the Holder hereof not less than ten days prior to such Special Record Date,
or may be paid at any time in any other lawful manner, all as more fully
provided in the Indenture.

      Payments of principal and interest on this Note shall be made in such coin
or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal
tender for the payment of public and private debts. Payments of interest on this
Note (other than on the Maturity Date or upon earlier redemption or repayment)
will be made by wire transfer to such account as has been


                                       3
<PAGE>

appropriately designated to the Paying Agent (as defined herein) by the person
entitled to such payments.

      The principal amount hereof and interest due at maturity or redemption
will be paid upon maturity or redemption in immediately available funds against
presentation of this Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, as
paying agent (the "Paying Agent") in New York, New York (as of the date of this
Note, such office being located at 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York
10286), or at such other office or agency of the Paying Agent as the Bank shall
designate by written notice to the registered Holder of this Note. The Trustee
is also the authenticating agent (the "Authenticating Agent") and the note
registrar (the "Note Registrar") for the Notes (as defined on the reverse
hereof).

      Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth
on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the
same effect as if set forth at this place.

      Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Trustee, by manual signature, this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit
under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

                                    [Reverse]

      This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Senior Notes (herein called
the "Notes") of the Bank issued and to be issued under an Indenture, dated as of
November 4, 1998 (herein called the "Indenture"), between the Bank and The Bank
of New York, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta (herein called the "FHLB of Atlanta") has joined as a consenting party,
to which Indenture and all Indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby
made for a statement of the respective rights, duties and obligations thereunder
of the Bank, the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and the terms upon which
the Notes are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. The Notes may bear
different dates, mature at different times, bear interest at different fixed or
floating rates, and differ in such other respects as provided herein or as may
be provided pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.

      Payment of the principal of and interest on this Note is supported by an
irrevocable standby letter of credit (herein called the "Letter of Credit")
issued to the Trustee by the FHLB of Atlanta pursuant to a certain Letter of
Credit Reimbursement Agreement (herein called the "Reimbursement Agreement")
between the Bank and the FHLB of Atlanta.

      Copies of the Indenture, the Letter of Credit, the Reimbursement Agreement
and other related credit documents are on file with the Trustee at its Corporate
Trust Office and are available for inspection at such office. Reference is made
to those documents for the terms upon which the Letter of Credit has been
issued, the liability of the FHLB of Atlanta under the Letter of Credit with
respect to payment of this Note and the procedures governing demands for payment
under the Letter of Credit by the Trustee.

      Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date shown on the face hereof
following the Original Issue Date shown on the face hereof, the rate at which
interest on this Note is payable (herein, called the "Interest Rate") shall be
adjusted weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually as shown on the
face hereof under "Interest Rate Reset Period." Each such adjusted rate shall be
applicable on and after the Interest Reset Date to which it relates to but not
including the next succeeding Interest Reset Date or until maturity or
redemption, as the case may be.

      If any Interest Reset Date would be a day that is not a Business Day, such
Interest Reset Date shall be postponed to the next succeeding day that is a
Business Day, except that in the case of a LIBOR Note, if such Business Day is
in the next succeeding calendar month, such Interest Reset Date shall be the
next preceding Business Day. "Business Day" means any day which is not a
Saturday or a Sunday and that in The City of New York and Atlanta, Georgia is
not a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law,
regulation or executive order to close and, with respect to which LIBOR is an
applicable interest rate formula, is also a London Business Day. "London
Business Day" means any day on which dealings in deposits in US Dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market.

      The interest rate applicable to each Interest Rate Reset Period commencing
on an Interest Reset Date will be the rate determined on the "Interest
Determination Date." The Interest 


                                       6
<PAGE>

Determination Date with respect to the CMT Rate, the Commercial Paper Rate, the
Federal Funds Rate and the Prime Rate will be the second Business Day preceding
each Interest Reset Date; the Interest Determination Date with respect to the
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate will be the last working day of the month
immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date on which the Federal Home Loan
Bank of San Francisco publishes the Index (as herein defined); and the Interest
Determination Date with respect to LIBOR will be the second London Business Day
immediately preceding each Interest Reset Date. With respect to the Treasury
Rate, the Interest Determination Date will be the day in the week in which the
related Interest Reset Date falls on which day Treasury Bills (as defined below)
are normally auctioned (Treasury Bills are normally sold at auction on Monday of
each week, unless the day is a legal holiday, in which case the auction is
normally held on the following Tuesday, except that such auction may be held on
the preceding Friday); provided, however, that if an auction is held on the
Friday of the week preceding the related Interest Reset Date, the related
Interest Determination Date will be such preceding Friday; and provided further
that if an auction falls on any Interest Reset Date, then the related Interest
Reset Date will instead be the first Business Day following such auction.

      The "Calculation Date", if applicable, pertaining to any Interest
Determination Date shall be the earlier of (i) the tenth calendar day after such
Interest Determination Date or, if such day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day or (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the
applicable Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or date of earlier redemption,
as the case may be.

      All percentages resulting from any calculation on this Note will be
rounded to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percent, with five
one-millionths of a percent rounded upward, e.g. 9.876545% (or .09876545) being
rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar amounts used in or resulting
from such calculation on this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent (with
one-half cent being rounded upward).

      Subject to applicable provisions of law and except as specified herein, on
each Interest Reset Date, the Interest Rate on this Note shall be the rate
determined in accordance with the provisions of the applicable heading or
headings below.

      DETERMINATION OF CMT RATE. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Note is the
CMT Rate, as indicated on the face hereof, the CMT Rate shall be determined as
of the applicable Interest Determination Date ("the CMT Rate Interest
Determination Date"), as the rate displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page
under the caption "...Treasury Constant Maturities...Federal Reserve Board
Release H.15...Mondays Approximately 3:45 P.M.," under the column for the
Designated CMT Maturity Index for (i) if the Designated CMT Telerate Page is
7055, the rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date and (ii) if the
Designated CMT Telerate Page is 7052, the weekly or monthly average, as
specified on the face hereof, for the week or the month, as applicable, ended
immediately preceding the week or the month, as applicable, in which the related
CMT Rate Interest Determination Date falls. If such rate is no longer displayed
on the relevant page or is not so displayed by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on
the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate for such CMT Rate Interest


                                       7
<PAGE>

Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the
Designated CMT Maturity Index as published in H.15(519). If such rate is no
longer published or is not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest
Determination Date will be such treasury constant maturity rate for the
Designated CMT Maturity Index (or other United States Treasury rate for the
Designated CMT Maturity Index) for the CMT Rate Interest Determination Date with
respect to such Interest Reset Date as may then be published by either the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the United States Department of
the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the rate
formerly displayed on the Designated CMT Telerate Page and published in
H.15(519). If such information is not so provided by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the related Calculation Date, then the CMT Rate on the CMT Rate
Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will
be a yield to maturity, based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary market
offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such CMT
Rate Interest Determination Date reported, according to their written records,
by three leading primary United States government securities dealers in The City
of New York (which may include Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation,
PaineWebber Incorporated and Prudential Securities Incorporated (the "Agents")
or their affiliates) (each, a "Reference Dealer") selected by the Calculation
Agent (from five such Reference Dealers selected by the Calculation Agent and
eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the
highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the
lowest)), for the most recently issued direct noncallable fixed rate obligations
of the United States ("Treasury Notes") with an original maturity of
approximately the Designated CMT Maturity Index and a remaining term to maturity
of not less than such Designated CMT Maturity Index minus one year. If the
Calculation Agent is unable to obtain three such Treasury Note quotations, the
CMT Rate on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the
Calculation Agent and will be a yield to maturity based on the arithmetic mean
of the secondary market offered rates as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York
City time, on such CMT Rate Interest Determination Date of three Reference
Dealers in The City of New York (from five such Reference Dealers selected by
the Calculation Agent and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of
equality, one of the highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of
equality, one of the lowest)), for Treasury Notes with an original maturity of
the number of years that is the next highest to the Designated CMT Maturity
Index and a remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated CMT Maturity
Index and in an amount of at least $100 million. If three or four (and not five)
of such Reference Dealers are quoting as described above, then the CMT Rate will
be based on the arithmetic mean of the offered rates obtained and neither the
highest nor the lowest of such quotes will be eliminated; provided, however,
that if fewer than three Reference Dealers so selected by the Calculation Agent
are quoting as mentioned herein, the CMT Rate determined as of such CMT Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the CMT Rate in effect on such CMT Rate
Interest Determination Date. If two Treasury Notes with an original maturity as
described in the second preceding sentence have remaining terms to maturity
equally close to the Designated CMT Maturity Index, the Calculation Agent will
obtain quotations for the Treasury Note with the shorter remaining term to
maturity.

      DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE. If an Interest Rate Basis for this
Note is the Commercial Paper Rate, as indicated on the face hereof, the
Commercial Paper Rate shall be determined as of the applicable Interest
Determination Date (a "Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date"), as

Update or another recognized electronic source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time,
on the related Calculation Date, then the Commercial Paper Rate on such
Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date will be calculated by the
Calculation Agent and will be the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean of
the offered rates at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such
Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination Date of three leading dealers of
commercial paper in The City of New York (which may include the Agents or their

Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Commercial
Paper Rate determined as of such Commercial Paper Rate Interest Determination
Date will be the Commercial Paper Rate in effect on such Commercial Paper Rate
Interest Determination Date.

      "Money Market Yield" means a yield (expressed as a percentage) calculated
in accordance with the following formula:

                   Money Market Yield =    D X 360
                                       --------------- X 100
                                        360 - (D X M)

equal to the monthly weighted average cost of funds for the calendar month
immediately preceding the month in which such Eleventh District Cost of Funds
Rate Interest Determination Date falls as set forth under the caption "11th
District" on the display on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on
page 7058 ("Telerate Page 7058") as of 11:00 A.M., San Francisco time, on such
Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date. If such rate
does not appear on Telerate Page 7058 on such Eleventh District Cost of Funds
Rate Interest Determination Date, then the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate
on such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination Date shall
be the monthly weighted average cost of funds paid by member institutions of the
Eleventh Federal Home Loan Bank District that was most recently announced (the
"Index") by the FHLB of San Francisco as such cost of funds for the calendar
month immediately preceding such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest
Determination Date. If the FHLB of San Francisco fails to announce the Index on
or prior to such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest Determination
Date for the calendar month immediately preceding such Eleventh District Cost of
Funds Rate Interest Determination Date, the Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate
determined as of such Eleventh District Cost of Funds Rate Interest

      DETERMINATION OF FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. If an Interest Rate Basis for this

Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 120 ("Telerate Page 120"), or,
if such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not so published by 3:00
P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on such
Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date for United States dollar federal
funds as published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic
source used for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "Federal
Funds (Effective)." If such rate does not appear on Telerate Page 120 or is not
yet published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic
source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then
the Federal Funds Rate on such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date
will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of
the rates for the last transaction in overnight United States dollar federal
funds arranged prior to 9:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Federal Funds
Rate Interest Determination Date by three leading brokers of federal funds
transactions in The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent;
provided, however, that if any of the brokers selected as aforesaid by the
Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Federal
Funds Rate determined as of such Federal Funds Rate Interest Determination Date
shall be the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such Federal Funds Rate Interest
Determination Date.

      DETERMINATION OF LIBOR. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Note is LIBOR,
as indicated on the face hereof, LIBOR shall be determined by the Calculation

      (i) LIBOR will be either: (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified is specified
      on the face hereof, the arithmetic mean of the offered rates (unless the
      Designated LIBOR Page by its terms provides only for a single rate, in
      which case such single rate shall be used) for deposits in the Designated
      LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof,
      commencing on the applicable Interest Reset Date, that appear (or, if only
      a single rate is required as aforesaid, appears) on the Designated LIBOR
      Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination
      Date, or (b) if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof or if
      neither "LIBOR Reuters" nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face
      hereof as the method for calculating LIBOR, the rate for deposits in the
      Designated LIBOR Currency having the Index Maturity specified on the face
      hereof, commencing on such Interest Reset Date, that appears on the
      Designated LIBOR Page as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such LIBOR
      Interest Determination Date. If fewer than two such offered rates so
      appear, or if no such rate so appears, as applicable, LIBOR on such LIBOR
      Interest Determination Date will be determined in accordance with the
      provisions described in clause (ii) below.

      (ii) With respect to a LIBOR Interest Determination Date on which fewer
      than two offered rates appear, or no rate appears, as the case may be, on
      the Designated LIBOR Page as specified in clause (i) above, the
      Calculation Agent will request the principal London offices of each of
      four major reference banks (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in
      the London interbank market, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to
      provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation for deposits in
      the Designated LIBOR Currency for the period of the Index Maturity
      specified on the face hereof, commencing on the applicable Interest Reset
      Date, to prime banks in the London interbank market at approximately 11:00
      A.M., London time, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a
      principal amount that is representative for a single transaction in the
      Designated LIBOR Currency in such market at such time. If at least two
      such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR Interest
      Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If
      fewer than two such quotations are so provided, then LIBOR on such LIBOR
      Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates
      quoted at approximately 11:00 A.M., in the applicable Principal Financial
      Center, on such LIBOR Interest Determination Date by three major banks
      (which may include affiliates of the Agents) in such Principal Financial
      Center selected by the Calculation Agent for loans in the Designated LIBOR
      Currency to leading European banks, having the Index Maturity specified on
      the face hereof commencing on the second London Business Day following
      that LIBOR Interest Determination Date and in a principal amount that is
      representative for a single transaction in the Designated LIBOR Currency
      in such market at such time; provided, however, that if the banks so
      selected by the Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this

<PAGE>

      "Designated LIBOR Page" means (a) if "LIBOR Reuters" is specified on the
face hereof, the display on the Reuter Monitor Money Rates Service (or any
successor service) on the page specified on the face hereof (or any other page
as may replace such page on such service) for the purpose of displaying the
London interbank rates of major banks for the Designated LIBOR Currency, or (b)
if "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof or neither "LIBOR Reuters"
nor "LIBOR Telerate" is specified on the face hereof as the method for
calculating LIBOR, the display on Bridge Telerate, Inc. (or any successor

Toronto, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Zurich, respectively.

      DETERMINATION OF PRIME RATE. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Note is
the Prime Rate, as indicated on the face hereof, the Prime Rate shall be
determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date"), as the rate on such date as such rate is

published in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic
source by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, then
the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest publicly
announced by each bank that appears on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page (as
hereinafter defined) as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect
for such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date. If fewer than four such rates
appear on the Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page for such Prime Rate Interest
Determination Date, then the Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean of the
prime rates or base lending rates quoted on the basis of the actual number of
days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of business on such
Prime Rate Interest Determination Date by four major money center banks (which
may include affiliates of the Agents) in The City of New York selected by the
Calculation Agent. If fewer than four such quotations are so provided, then the
Prime Rate shall be the arithmetic mean of four prime rates quoted on the basis
of the actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the
close of business on such Prime Rate Interest Determination Date as furnished in
The City of New York by the major money center banks, if any, that have provided
such quotations and by a reasonable number of substitute banks or trust
companies (which may include affiliates of the Agents) to obtain four such prime
rate quotations, provided such substitute banks or trust companies are organized
and doing business under the laws of the United States, or any State thereof,
each having total equity capital of at least $500 million and being subject to

mentioned in this sentence, the Prime Rate determined as of such Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Prime Rate
Interest Determination Date.


                                       12
<PAGE>

      "Reuters Screen USPRIME1 Page" means the display on the Reuter Monitor

      DETERMINATION OF TREASURY RATE. If an Interest Rate Basis for this Note is
the Treasury Rate, as indicated on the face hereof, the Treasury Rate shall be
determined as of the applicable Interest Determination Date (a "Treasury Rate
Interest Determination Date"), as the rate from the auction held on such
Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date (the "Auction") of direct obligations
of the United States ("Treasury Bills") having the Index Maturity specified on
the face hereof under the caption "AVGE INVEST YIELD" on the display on Bridge
Telerate, Inc. (or any successor service) on page 56 ("Telerate Page 56") or
page 57 ("Telerate Page 57") or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City
time, on the related Calculation Date, the auction average rate of such Treasury
Bills (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as otherwise announced by the
United States Department of the Treasury. In the event that the results of the
Auction of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof
are not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related
Calculation Date, or if no such Auction is held, then the Treasury Rate will be
the rate (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366
days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) on such Treasury Rate
Interest Determination Date of Treasury Bills having the Index Maturity
specified on the face hereof as published in H.15(519) under the caption "U.S.
Government Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market" or, if not yet published
by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the related Calculation Date, the rate on
such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date of such Treasury Bills as
published in H.15 Daily Update, or such other recognized electronic source used
for the purpose of displaying such rate, under the caption "U.S. Government
Securities/Treasury Bills/Secondary Market." If such rate is not yet published
in H.15(519), H.15 Daily Update or another recognized electronic source, then
the Treasury Rate will be calculated by the Calculation Agent and will be a
yield to maturity (expressed as a bond equivalent on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as applicable, and applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean
of the secondary market bid rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City
time, on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date, of three leading
primary United States government securities dealers (which may include the
Agents or their affiliates) selected by the Calculation Agent, for the issue of
Treasury Bills with a remaining maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified
on the face hereof; provided, however, that if the dealers so selected by the
Calculation Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the Treasury
Rate determined as of such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date will be the
Treasury Rate in effect on such Treasury Rate Interest Determination Date.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate hereon shall not be
greater than the Maximum Interest Rate specified on the face hereof or less than
the Minimum Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. In addition to
any Maximum Interest Rate applicable hereto pursuant to the above provisions,
the interest rate on this Note will in no event be higher than the maximum rate
permitted by New York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of
general application. The Calculation Agent shall calculate the interest rate
hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or before each Calculation Date.
Unless otherwise specified on the face hereof, the Trustee will be the
Calculation Agent.


                                       13
<PAGE>

      At the request of the Holder hereof, the Calculation Agent shall provide
to the Holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if determined,
the interest rate which shall become effective as of the next Interest Reset
Date.

      Interest payments hereon made on any Interest Payment Date or at maturity
or upon redemption will include interest accrued to but not including such
Interest Payment Date or date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be.
Accrued interest hereon from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to
which interest hereon has been paid, as the case may be, shall be an amount
calculated by multiplying the face amount hereof by an accrued interest factor.
Such accrued interest factor shall be computed by adding the interest factor
calculated for each day from the Original Issue Date or from the last date to
which interest shall have been paid, as the case may be, to the date for which
accrued interest is being calculated. The interest factor for each such day
shall be computed by dividing the Interest Rate applicable to such day by 360 if
the Interest Rate Basis is the Commercial Paper Rate, the Eleventh District Cost
of Funds Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, LIBOR or the Prime Rate Notes, as
indicated on the face hereof or by the actual number of days in the year if the
Interest Rate Basis is the CMT Rate or the Treasury Rate as indicated on the
face hereof.

      This Note is subject to mandatory redemption in whole, but not in part, at
any time, at a Redemption Price equal to the principal amount hereof plus
accrued interest to the Redemption Date (i) in the event that a demand under the
Letter of Credit has been made for a payment of principal of or interest on this
Note or any Note issued pursuant to the Indenture and the Trustee fails to
receive notice from the FHLB of Atlanta within five Business Days thereafter
(I.E., within five Business Days after submission to the FHLB of Atlanta by the
Trustee of a drawing certificate under the Letter of Credit) that the Credit
Amount of the Letter of Credit has been reinstated or (ii) upon the occurrence
of certain Events of Default, or upon the declaration of acceleration of the
principal of all the Notes following the occurrence of certain other Events of
Default, all in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. In the event
this Note shall be called for redemption, notice thereof shall be given by the
Trustee by mailing a copy of the redemption notice to the Holder hereof at the
address shown in the Note Register. If notice of redemption shall have been duly
given, and funds for the payment of interest to the Redemption Date shall be on
deposit with the Trustee on such Redemption Date, this Note shall cease to bear
interest on the Redemption Date.

      Except as provided in the preceding paragraph, this Note is not redeemable
prior to the Maturity Date shown on the face hereof or otherwise subject to
prepayment; provided, however, that if an Event of Default, as defined in the
Indenture, shall occur, the principal of all the Notes may be declared due and
payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

      The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of rights and obligations of the Bank and
the rights of the Holders of the Notes at any time by the Bank and the Trustee
with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time Outstanding,
on behalf of the Holders of all Notes, to waive compliance by the Bank with
certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the
Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent of waiver by the 


                                       14
<PAGE>


Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not
notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

      No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Bank, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the time, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

      As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Note may be registered on the Note Register of
the Bank, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office
or agency of the Note Registrar in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in
form satisfactory to the Bank and the Note Registrar duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or
more new Notes of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, having the identical Original Issue Date, Maturity Date and provisions
with respect to payment of interest, will be issued to the designated transferee
or transferees.

      Prior to due presentment of this Note for registration of transfer, the
Bank and the Trustee, and any agent of the Bank and the Trustee, may treat the
Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Bank or the
Trustee, nor any such agent, shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

      The Notes are issuable only in fully registered form in minimum
denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

      Beneficial interests represented by this Note are exchangeable for
definitive Notes in registered form, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate
principal amount, only if (x) The Depository Trust Company, as Depositary (the
"Depositary") notifies the Bank that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Depositary for this Note or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a
clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Bank within 90 days,
(y) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect
to this Note, or (z) the Bank in its sole discretion determines that this Note
will be so exchangeable. Any Note representing such beneficial interests that is
exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable in whole
for definitive Notes in registered form, of like tenor and of an equal aggregate
principal amount, in minimum denominations of $250,000 and integral multiples of
$1,000 in excess thereof. Such definitive Notes shall be registered in the name
or names of such person or persons as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee.

      No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Bank may require a payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

                    LETTER OF CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT, dated as of November 4, 1998, is between BANKUNITED, FSB, having
its principal office at 255 Alhambra Circle, Coral Gables, Florida 33134 (the
"Member"), and FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF ATLANTA, Atlanta, Georgia (the "Bank").

WHEREAS, the Member proposes to issue from time to time its promissory notes in
an aggregate principal amount up to $500 million (the "Senior Notes"), pursuant
to an Indenture to be dated as of November 4, 1998, a copy of which has
heretofore been furnished to the Bank (the "Indenture") between the Member and
The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Beneficiary"), to which the Bank shall
join as a consenting party; and

WHEREAS, the issuance of the Senior Notes will provide funds to the Member that
will promote home financing or housing activity and encourage and assist the
Member's asset and liability management; and

WHEREAS, to provide for the payment of interest, principal and Redemption
Premium (as defined in the Indenture), if any, on the Senior Notes, the Member
has requested the Bank to issue its letter of credit in the form attached as
Exhibit A hereto (such letter of credit, as the same may from time to time be
supplemented or amended, being hereinafter referred to as the "Credit") for the
benefit of the Beneficiary, whereby the Bank would agree, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein, to honor drawings by the Beneficiary in such
amount as is set forth in the outstanding Credit (such amount, as the same may
from time to time be changed subject to the terms and conditions herein, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Credit Amount"); and

WHEREAS, in connection with the issuance of the Credit, the Member on the date
hereof (the "Closing Date") delivered to the Bank (i) the written opinion of
counsel to the Member dated as of the Closing Date in the form referred to in
Section 5(a) of the Distribution Agreement dated as of November 4, 1998 (the
"Distribution Agreement"), between the Member, Credit Suisse First Boston
Corporation, PaineWebber Incorporated, and Prudential Securities Incorporated
(the "Agents") and (ii) certified copies of the resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the Member referred to in Section 301(c) of the Indenture; and

WHEREAS, the Bank is issuing the Credit on the date hereof with an initial
Credit Amount of $225,000,000.00 and an initial expiration date as of the close
of business of the Bank on November 4, 2008 (such initial expiration date as the
same may be extended in the manner provided herein is hereinafter referred to as
the "Expiration Date"); and


                                       1


<PAGE>





WHEREAS, the Member and the Bank have entered into an Advances, Specific
Collateral Pledge and Security Agreement dated March 30, 1998 (such agreement,
including any amendments thereto and any successor agreement that may be entered
into by the Member and the Bank in substitution for such agreement, is
hereinafter referred to as the "Advances Agreement"), whereby the Bank may
advance funds to the Member from time to time under the terms and conditions
thereof; and

WHEREAS, subject to the provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the
"Act"), and the regulations and guidelines of the Federal Housing Finance Board
("FHFB") or any successor entity (the "Regulations"), and the Bank's Credit
Policy, the Bank is authorized to issue the Credit.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Member and the Bank agree as follows:

1.   The Credit.

     (a) CONFIRMATION. The Member agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
         contained herein, and in the Confirmation of Letter of Credit, in the
         form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Confirmation"), issued with
         respect to the Credit.

     (b) APPLICATIONS. From time to time during the period this Agreement is
         effective, the Member may submit applications under the Credit, in the
         form and manner to be provided by the Bank, which applications the Bank
         may deny on grounds that (i) the Member fails to meet the Bank's
         guidelines for extension of credit; (ii) the purpose of the underlying
         obligation supported by the Credit is contrary to the Act, Regulation
         or policies applicable to advances and letters of credit established by
         the FHFB, any successor entity, or the Board of Directors of the Bank;
         (iii) the Bank determines that approval of such application would
         expose the Bank to an unreasonable risk; or (iv) such other reasons as
         the Bank may reasonably establish.

     (c) AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT. From time to time during the currency of the
         Credit, the Bank agrees that it will, subject to the terms and
         conditions set forth herein, supplement or amend the terms of the
         Credit, upon the application of the Member. The obligation of the Bank
         to supplement or amend the terms of the Credit, including any increase
         in the Credit Amount or any extension of the Expiration Date of the
         Credit, is subject to the fulfillment, at no cost to the Bank, of the
         following conditions precedent: (i) the Bank shall have received by
         2:00 p.m., Atlanta time, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
         to it, one business day's prior oral and written notice from the Member
         of the effective date; (ii) the representations and


                                       2


<PAGE>





         warranties of the Member contained in Section 6 hereof shall be true
         and correct as of the effective date of such change as though made upon
         and as of such date; (iii) no event shall have occurred and be
         continuing, or would result from the change of the Credit, which would
         constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement or would constitute
         such an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be given
         or time elapse or both; (iv) no change shall have occurred in any
         federal, state or foreign law or regulation or in the interpretation
         thereof which, in the opinion of counsel for the Bank, may make it
         impermissible for the Bank to change the Credit as contemplated hereby;
         and (v) the Member shall have submitted an application for the
         amendment to the Credit in the form to be provided by the Bank, which
         application the Bank may deny on the grounds set forth in Section
         1(b)(i)-(iv) hereof. The Expiration Date of the Credit may be extended
         by an amendment to the terms of the Credit pursuant to this Section
         1(c), provided that the period from the date such extension is
         effective through the Expiration Date shall not exceed such period as
         the Act, the Regulations, and the Bank's Credit Policy may allow. The
         Bank's approval of (A) an increase in the Credit Amount pursuant to
         this Section 1(c) shall be evidenced by a Certificate Increasing Credit
         Amount in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C, an original copy of
         which will be sent by the Bank to the Beneficiary by overnight mail;
         and (B) an extension in the Expiration Date pursuant to this Section
         1(c) shall be evidenced by a Certificate Renewing Letter of Credit by
         Amending Expiration Date to Later Date in the form attached hereto as
         Exhibit D.

         Upon the Bank's issuance of any amendment of the Credit, the Member
         shall promptly sign and return to the Bank the Confirmation of
         Amendment to Letter of Credit, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E
         (the "Amendment Confirmation"), setting forth the terms upon which the
         Bank and the Member have agreed with respect to the amendment to the
         Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the failure of the
         Member to deliver to the Bank, prior to the effective date of any
         amendment of the Credit as specified in the related Amendment
         Confirmation, written notice to the Bank specifying any disputed term
         or condition set forth in the Amendment Confirmation shall constitute
         the agreement and acknowledgment by the Member that the terms and
         conditions of the Credit as amended are valid and are those which the
         Member requested and by which the Member agreed to be bound, and the
         Member shall be estopped from asserting any claim or defense with
         respect to the repayment of any draw under the Credit as amended or
         otherwise with respect to those terms and conditions.

     (d) REDUCTION OF CREDIT AMOUNT. From time to time and at any time


                                       3


<PAGE>





         during the currency of the Credit, the Member may request the Bank to
         reduce the undrawn Credit Amount by such amount as specified in a
         Certificate Regarding Reduction of Credit, in the form attached as
         Exhibit F hereto (the "Reduction Certificate"), presented to the Bank
         by the Beneficiary under the Credit, provided, however, that the Bank
         is entitled to rely upon the Reduction Certificate as presented. The
         Credit Amount shall be reduced automatically in accordance with the
         related Reduction Certificate upon receipt of the same by the Bank.

2.   PAYMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT. For purposes of this Agreement and the Advances
     Agreement the Credit Amount plus any unreimbursed payment made by the Bank
     shall constitute "Advances" by the Bank to the Member and "Advances" as
     such term is used in the Advances Agreement. The Member agrees that any
     such payment made by the Bank under the Credit shall be reimbursed by the
     Member unconditionally and immediately upon demand by the Bank. Upon the
     Bank's receipt of a certificate demanding payment under the Credit, the
     Bank will make an oral or written demand to the Member for reimbursement.
     Any oral demands by the Bank for reimbursement shall be confirmed
     concurrently in writing. For purposes of this Section 2, an Advance shall
     be deemed to have been reimbursed immediately if payment is received by
     the Bank (or credited to the Member's account) not later than 2:00 p.m.,
     Atlanta time, on the next Business Day after an oral or written demand for
     reimbursement has been made by the Bank. Any failure by the Member to
     provide such immediate reimbursement shall constitute a default under this
     Agreement. The Member agrees to pay the Bank interest on such amounts in
     default at the rate in effect and charged by the Bank from time to time on
     overdrafts on demand deposit accounts of its members, but in no event more
     than any applicable limit set by Regulations. Nothing herein shall prevent
     the Member from applying for an Advance under any other advance plan of
     the Bank for the funding of such reimbursement. The Member agrees to pay
     any reasonable costs of collection including reasonable attorneys' fees,
     if such reimbursements are collected by or through an attorney at law. The
     Member hereby authorizes the Bank to debit the Member's demand account(s)
     with the Bank for any and all reimbursement due the Bank and for all fees,
     charges and other amounts payable in connection with the Credit hereunder.
     In the event that the balance in such demand account(s) is insufficient to
     pay such amounts, the Bank may without prior notice to the Member apply
     any other deposits, credits, monies or other property of the Member then
     in the possession of the Bank (and not held as bailee for a third party)
     to the payment of such due and payable amounts. The Bank will promptly
     notify the Member following the taking of any such action.

     Upon any payment by the Bank of a drawing under the Credit, the Credit
     Amount shall be reduced as provided in the Credit, and by the close of


                                       4


<PAGE>





     business on the fifth Business Day after the date of such drawing the
     Credit Amount shall be reinstated by the amount of such drawing provided
     that the Beneficiary has received from the Bank by telecopy or otherwise, a
     Certificate Reinstating the Credit Amount substantially in the form of
     Exhibit G hereto with respect to such drawing. The Bank will reinstate the
     Credit Amount, provided that each of the following conditions shall be
     satisfied by 12:00 noon, Atlanta time, on the fifth Business Day following
     the date of demand by the Beneficiary under the Credit (i.e., the
     submission by the Beneficiary of a conforming drawing certificate under the
     Credit): (a) the Bank shall have been reimbursed in full by the Member for
     the amount of any payment made, or to be made as a result of such drawing,
     by the Bank under the Credit, together with interest thereon as provided
     herein; (b) the Bank shall have received from the Member a written request
     for such reinstatement; and (c) the Bank shall not have determined that
     there has occurred and is continuing an "Event of Default" or any event
     which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would
     constitute such an Event of Default.

3.   COLLATERAL AND SECURITY INTEREST. In consideration of the issuance of the
     Credit and to secure all Advances and all of the other obligations of the
     Member hereunder, the Member hereby assigns, transfers and pledges to the
     Bank and grants to the Bank a security interest in all collateral now or
     hereafter pledged to the Bank under the Advances Agreement and applicable
     Bank Credit and Collateral Policies ("Collateral"). The terms and
     conditions in the Advances Agreement applicable to security and collateral
     shall apply to Advances to the same extent and in the same manner in which
     they apply to advances made under the Advances Agreement. Without limiting
     the generality of the foregoing, the collateral requirements otherwise
     applicable to Advances made by the Bank under the Advances Agreement and
     applicable Bank Credit and Collateral Policies shall apply to Advances
     hereunder, and the amount of Collateral that the Member is required to
     pledge to the Bank shall be based on the amount of outstanding Advances to
     the Member under the Advances Agreement plus Advances hereunder.

4.   ACCEPTANCE AND HONOR OF CREDIT. The Bank agrees to: (a) accept and pay
     drafts or other documents requesting payment under the Credit drawn in
     conformity with this Credit; (b) honor drafts or other documents
     requesting payment drawn under the Credit for less than or equal to the
     Credit Amount; (c) accept or pay, as complying with the terms of the
     Credit, any drafts or other documents requesting payments signed or issued
     by any trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for benefit
     of creditors, liquidator, receiver, conservator, attorney-in-fact or other
     representative of the Beneficiary or of any successor or assign approved
     in writing by the Bank; (d) accept or pay any drafts or other


                                       5


<PAGE>





     documents requesting payment dated and presented on or before the
     Expiration Date of the Credit, regardless of when drawn and when or whether
     negotiated; and (e) accept documents of any character which comply with the
     terms of the Credit.

5.   FEES AND OTHER CHARGES. The Member agrees to pay the Bank, on demand, any
     and all reasonable charges and expenses (including, but not limited to,
     attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses) paid or incurred by the
     Bank in connection with the preparation, negotiation and enforcement of
     this Agreement or any amendment hereto. In addition, the Member agrees to
     pay to the Bank the applicable fees for the establishment and maintenance
     of the Credit issued hereunder (plus any applicable fees for any increase,
     extension, amendment, renewal or partial renewal thereof) as shall be
     contemplated by the Bank's Credit Policy and by that certain letter
     agreement of even date herewith between the Bank and the Member. The
     Member agrees to pay or reimburse the Bank, upon its request, for all
     reasonable third party expenses incurred by the Bank in the administration
     of the Credit.

6.   MEMBER'S WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS. The Member represents,
     warrants and covenants to the Bank that the following are and shall remain
     true, complete and correct as of the date hereof and for so long as the
     Credit shall be outstanding: (a) this Agreement has been duly and validly
     executed and delivered by the Member and its execution, delivery and
     performance have been authorized by all necessary corporate action on
     behalf of the Member; (b) neither this Agreement nor the Credit nor any
     transaction to which this Agreement or the Credit relates violates any law
     or regulation applicable to the Member, including, without limitation, any
     applicable federal or state securities laws and regulations; (c) the
     Member has duly entered into the Advances Agreement and the same is
     currently in full force and effect; and (d) the Member will maintain one
     or more demand accounts with the Bank at all times during which any Credit
     issued hereunder remains outstanding.

     In addition, the Member represents and warrants to the Bank as of the date
     hereof and as of each subsequent date contemplated in Section 1of the
     Distribution Agreement to the same effect as set forth in and contemplated
     by Section1 of the Distribution Agreement, and the Member further agrees
     that each confirmation of the parties' agreement to an amendment to the
     Credit as evidenced by the Member's signing and returning to the Bank an
     Amendment Confirmation in accordance with Section 1 hereof shall be deemed
     (a) an affirmation by the Member that its representations, warranties and
     covenants as set forth in this Section 6 are true and correct at the time
     of return of the related Amendment Confirmation to the Bank, as though made
     at and as of each such


                                       6


<PAGE>





     time, (b) an undertaking that such representations and warranties will be
     true and correct at the time such amendment to the Credit becomes effective
     and (c) an affirmation by the Member that it is in compliance with its
     covenants as set forth in this Section 6.

     The Member covenants to the Bank that (a) it will furnish to the Bank
     copies of the financial statements and other documents as contemplated by
     Section 5 of the Distribution Agreement at such time as the same are
     furnished to the Agents thereunder, (b) it will immediately inform the Bank
     as to any matters notice of which is given to the Agents pursuant to
     Section 5 of the Distribution Agreement, and (c) it will furnish to the
     Bank, a reasonable time prior to the use thereof, any Offering Circular (as
     defined in the Distribution Agreement) or other material which the Member
     proposes to use in connection with the offer or sale of the Senior Notes
     which refers to the Bank or the Credit and that it will not use any
     Offering Circular (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) or other
     material to which the Bank has objected.

7.   LIABILITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BANK. It is agreed that the Bank
     shall not be responsible for, and no obligation of the Bank under the
     Credit shall be affected by or in respect of: (a) the use which may be
     made of the Credit or any act or omission of any Beneficiary or assignee
     of the Credit; (b) the validity, authenticity, sufficiency, completeness,
     genuineness or collectibility of any drafts, instruments, notices of
     default, or other documents, including endorsements and signatures
     thereon; (c) any breach of contract (other than in respect of the Senior
     Notes), including, without limitation, the Distribution Agreement between
     the Member and any other party other than the Bank; (d) compliance with or
     circumstances resulting from the existence or exercise of applicable laws,
     regulations, customs, controls or restrictions by any government or by any
     group asserting or exercising de facto or de jure governmental powers; (e)
     any failure of drafts or other evidences of withdrawal to bear reference
     or adequate reference to the Credit, or failure of any person to
     surrender, take up or forward the Credit, or to note thereon any
     withdrawal thereunder, each of which requirements the Bank may waive even
     if included in the Credit; (f) any errors, omissions, interruptions or
     delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, however sent and
     whether plain or in code or cipher, or errors in translation or in
     interpretation of technical or other terms, absent the Bank's gross
     negligence or bad faith; (g) any event, fact or condition beyond the
     control of the Bank; and (h) without limiting the foregoing, any act or
     omission of the Bank or any confirming or advising bank or any of the
     Bank's correspondents, agents or subagents done or omitted in good faith
     (excepting, however, any such act or omission that contravenes the Bank's
     obligations under the governing laws and


                                       7


<PAGE>





     authorities referred to in Section 11 of this Agreement). The Bank is
     expressly authorized and directed to honor any draft or other request for
     payment which is made under and in compliance with the Credit without
     regard to, and without any duty to inquire into, the existence of any
     disputes or controversies between the Member, the Beneficiary or any other
     person or firm, or their respective rights, duties or liabilities or
     whether any fact or event referred to in any notice of default or other
     document presented under the Credit is true and correct. Except for the
     obligation of the Bank set forth in the last sentence of Section 2 hereof,
     the sole obligation of the Bank to the Member in connection with drawings
     under the Credit is limited to honoring requests for payment made under and
     in compliance with the Credit, and the Bank shall have no liability to the
     Member in connection with any such drawing even though the Bank may have
     prepared the Credit or any notice of default or other document required to
     be presented thereunder and even though the Bank may otherwise be aware of
     facts concerning the transaction which gives rise to the drawing under the
     Credit.

8.   EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The following occurrences shall be Events of Default:
     (a) any Event of Default as defined in the Advances Agreement; (b) the
     failure of the Member to pay any amount due hereunder; (c) the breach by
     the Member of, or the failure by the Member to comply in all respects
     with, any covenant, agreement, term or condition under or in connection
     with this Agreement if the Member shall not have cured such breach or
     failure within 10 days after notice thereof from the Bank; (d) any failure
     at any time of any representation or warranty or information, furnished by
     the Member to the Bank in any context, to be and remain true, correct and
     complete in all material respects; or (e) any failure by the Member to
     furnish the Bank such information, and such access to all its books and
     records, and copies thereof, as the Bank may reasonably require.

9.   REMEDIES Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, without limiting any
     other rights and remedies which may be available at law or in equity, the
     Bank shall have all rights and remedies as provided for in respect of a
     default under the Advances Agreement.

10.  ISSUANCE OF FURTHER NOTES. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the
     Bank may, in its sole discretion, without limiting any other rights and
     remedies which may be available at law or in equity, issue written
     instructions (or telephonic instructions, confirmed in writing in
     accordance with Section 107 of the Indenture promptly thereafter) to the
     Beneficiary not to issue or deliver Senior Notes, which instructions may
     be specified with respect to a particular issue of Senior Notes or may be
     general and applicable to all Senior Notes requested to be issued or


                                       8


<PAGE>





     delivered after receipt of such instructions, until revoked or superseded
     by further instructions from the Bank.

11.  GOVERNING LAW; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. In addition to the terms and
     conditions specifically set forth herein and in any Confirmation between
     the Bank and the Member, this Agreement and the Credit shall be governed
     by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, Rules and Regulations of the FHFB,
     policies, guidelines and directives of the FHFB, and the statutory and
     common law of the United States and, to the extent federal law
     incorporates or defers to state law, the laws of the State of Georgia
     (without giving effect to choice of law principles included therein).
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as
     in effect in the State of Georgia shall be deemed applicable to this
     Agreement and to any Credit hereunder. It is further agreed that this
     Agreement shall be supplemented by the provisions (to the extent that such
     provisions are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement) of the
     Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision),
     International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 500 and, to the extent
     not inconsistent therewith, by the provisions of Article 5 of the Uniform
     Commercial Code as in effect in the State of Georgia. All rights and
     remedies of the Bank hereunder are cumulative of each other and of every
     other right or remedy which the Bank may otherwise have at law or in
     equity or under any contract or other writing for the enforcement of the
     security interest herein or the collection of any amount due hereunder.

12.  WAIVER; AMENDMENT; SEVERABILITY. No delay or failure on the part of the
     Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege shall operate as a waiver
     thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power
     or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
     any other right, power or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any
     Event of Default. No waiver by the Bank of any Event of Default shall be
     effective unless in writing and signed by an authorized officer of the
     Bank, and no such waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver of a subsequent
     Event of Default or be deemed to be a continuing waiver. No course of
     dealing between the Member and the Bank or its agents or employees shall
     be effective to change, modify or discharge any provision of this
     Agreement or to constitute a waiver of any default. If any provision of
     this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable to any extent or in any
     application, the remainder of this Agreement, or the application of such
     provision to different persons or circumstances or in different
     jurisdictions, shall not be affected thereby.

13.  INDEMNITY. Member agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Bank
     and the Bank's correspondents, agents and subagents, and its directors,
     officers and employees, from and against any and all demands,


                                       9


<PAGE>





     actions, damages, claims, losses, penalties, liabilities and expenses
     (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses whether or not suit is
     instituted), not involving any Indemnitee's (as defined below) bad faith or
     any willful breach of any Indemnitee's obligations under this Agreement or
     the Credit, or involving any violation by any Indemnitee of obligations
     under the governing laws and authorities referred to in Section 11 of this
     Agreement, resulting from or incurred, suffered or paid by any of them in
     connection with this Agreement, the Credit, or any breach or failure in
     respect of the Member of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement,
     term or condition set forth in or referred to in this Agreement.

     The Member further agrees to assume liability for and to indemnify,
     protect, save and hold harmless the Bank, each individual, corporation,
     partnership, trust, association or other entity ("Person") controlling the
     Bank, any affiliate of any such Person or the Bank and their respective
     directors, officers, incorporators, shareholders, partners, servants,
     trustees, employees and agents (the "Indemnitees") from and against any and
     all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action,
     suits, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
     attorneys' fees and expenses whether or not suit is instituted) or
     judgments of whatever kind and nature, imposed upon, incurred by or
     asserted against the Indemnitees, which are (x) based upon or arising under
     the securities laws of the United States of America or of any state or any
     regulation, rule, or interpretation thereunder or thereof to the extent
     arising from the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Distribution
     Agreement, (y) based upon the inaccuracy of any representation made or
     reaffirmed by the Member, or (z) based upon any untrue statement or alleged
     untrue statement of a material fact in the Offering Circular (as defined in
     the Distribution Agreement), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
     of a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If any
     action, suit or proceeding arising from any of the foregoing is brought
     against any of the Indemnitees, the Member will, if requested in writing
     within a reasonable time to do so, and at its own expense, resist and
     defend such action, suit or proceeding or cause the same to be resisted and
     defended by counsel designated by the Member (which counsel shall be
     satisfactory to such Indemnitees) and regardless of whether the Member is a
     party to the same, pay all reasonable costs and expenses of such defense
     (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses).

     It is agreed, however, that the obligations of the Member under this
     Section 13 shall not extend to any liability of any Indemnitee arising out
     of any untrue statement by any Indemnitee (whether written or oral)


                                      10


<PAGE>





     of a material fact in connection with the issue and sale of the Senior
     Notes, or any omission by any Indemnitee to state a material fact necessary
     to make any statement by any Indemnitee, in light of the circumstances
     under which it was made, not misleading, in connection with the issue and
     sale of the Senior Notes, except to the extent such untrue statement or
     omission was made by such Indemnitee on the basis of information provided
     by or omitted to be provided by the Member. The provisions of this Section
     13 shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver on the part of the Member of
     any of its rights at law or in equity against any Indemnitee in any
     circumstance contemplated by the preceding sentence hereof.

     The foregoing indemnity will also extend to any supplemental material
     subsequently furnished to the Agents by the Member and distributed to
     purchasers or prospective purchasers during the term of the Distribution
     Agreement.

     In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in
     which the indemnification provided for in this Section 13 is for any reason
     held unavailable (otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this
     Section 13), the Member and any Indemnitees sought to be charged with any
     liability shall contribute to the aggregate costs of satisfying such
     liability in the proportion of their respective economic interests. For
     purposes of this Section 13, the "economic interests" of the Member shall
     be equal to the aggregate proceeds of the Senior Notes issued in connection
     with the Distribution Agreement received by the Member and the "economic
     interests" of any Indemnitee shall be equal to the aggregate commissions
     and fees earned by the Bank as a result of the issuance of the Credit.

     The obligations of the Member under this Section 13 shall survive any
     termination of the Indenture, in whole or in part, or of the Credit or this
     Agreement, in whole or in part.

14.  OTHER LETTER OF CREDIT REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS. In the event that at any
     time there shall be in effect any Letter of Credit Reimbursement Agreement
     between the Member and the Bank other than this Agreement, the terms and
     provisions of this Agreement shall be the sole terms and provisions
     applicable to the Credit and the respective rights and obligations of the
     parties hereunder.

15.  COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
     all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument,
     and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any
     such counterpart.


                                      11

such persons with annual and long term performance incentives to expend their
maximum efforts in the creation of shareholder value.

         3.       ADMINISTRATION.

                  (a) AUTHORITY OF THE COMMITTEE. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall
have full and final authority to take the following actions, in each case
subject to and consistent with the provisions of the Plan:

                           (i) to select Participants to whom Awards may be
granted;

                           (ii)     to designate Affiliates;

                           (iii) to determine the type or types of Awards to be
granted to each Participant;

                           (iv) to determine the type and number of Awards to be
         granted, the number and type of shares of Stock to which an Award may
         relate, the terms and conditions of any Award granted under the Plan
         (including, but not limited to, any exercise price, grant price, or
         purchase price, any restriction or condition, any schedule for lapse of
         restrictions or conditions relating to transferability or forfeiture,
         exercisability, or settlement of an Award, and waivers or accelerations
         thereof, and waivers of performance conditions relating to an Award,
         based in each case on such considerations as the Committee shall
         determine), and all other matters to be determined in connection with
         an Award;

                           (v) to determine whether, and to what extent, the
         right of a Participant to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of
         any Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance
         conditions as may be specified by the Committee. The Committee may use
         such business criteria and other measures of performance as it may deem
         appropriate in establishing any performance conditions, and may
         exercise its discretion to reduce or increase the amounts payable under
         any Award subject to performance conditions;

                           (vi) to determine whether, to what extent, and under
         what circumstances an Award may be settled or the exercise price of an
         Award may be cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, or surrendered;

                           (vii) to determine whether, to what extent, and under
         what circumstances an Award will be deferred either automatically, at
         the election of the Committee, or at the election of the Participant,
         and whether to create trusts and deposit Stock or other property
         therein;

                           (viii) to prescribe the form of each Award Agreement,
         which need not be identical for each Participant;

                           (ix) to adopt, amend, suspend, waive, and rescind
         such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Committee may
         deem necessary or advisable to administer the Plan;

                           (x) to correct any defect or supply any omission or
         reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan and to construe and interpret
         the Plan and any Award, rules and regulations, Award Agreement, or
         other instrument hereunder; and

                           (xi) to make all other decisions and determinations
         as may be required under the terms of the Plan or as the Committee may
         deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.

Other provisions of the Plan notwithstanding, the Board may perform any function
of the Committee under the Plan, including without limitation for the purpose of
ensuring that transactions under the Plan by Participants who are then subject
to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company are exempt under
Rule 16b-3. In any case in which the Board is performing a function of the
Committee under the Plan, each reference to the Committee herein shall be deemed
to refer to the Board.

                                       A-3


<PAGE>



                  (b) MANNER OF EXERCISE OF COMMITTEE AUTHORITY. At any time
that a member of the Committee is not a Non-Employee Director as defined in Rule
16b-3, any action of the Committee relating to an Award granted or to be granted
to a Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in
respect of the Company may be taken either (i) by a subcommittee, designated by
the Committee, composed solely of two or more members who are Non-Employee
Directors, or (ii) by the Committee but with each such member who is not a
Non-Employee Director abstaining or recusing himself or herself from such
action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, upon such abstention or recusal, the Committee
remains composed solely of two or more members who are Non-Employee Directors.
Such action, authorized by such a subcommittee or by the Committee upon the
abstention or recusal of such non-qualifying member(s), shall be the action of
the Committee for purposes of the Plan. Any action of the Committee with respect
to the Plan shall be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, including
the Company, Subsidiaries, Affiliates, Participants, any person claiming any
rights under the Plan from or through any Participant, and stockholders. The
express grant of any specific power to the Committee, and the taking of any
action by the Committee, shall not be construed as limiting any power or
authority of the Committee. The Committee may delegate to officers or managers
of the Company or any Subsidiary the authority, subject to such terms as the
Committee shall determine, to perform administrative functions and such other
functions as the Committee may determine, to the extent permitted under
applicable law, and in the case of a Participant then subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to the extent that such delegation
will not result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d)(1).

                  (c) LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Each member of the Committee
shall be entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other
information furnished to him or her by any officer or other employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, the Company's independent certified
public accountants, or other professional retained by the Company to assist in
the administration of the Plan. No member of the Committee, nor any officer or
employee of the Company acting on behalf of the Committee, shall be personally
liable for any action, determination, or interpretation taken or made in good
faith with respect to the Plan, and all members of the Committee and any officer
or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries acting on their behalf shall, to
the extent permitted by law, be fully indemnified and protected by the Company
with respect to any such action, determination, or interpretation.

         4.       ELIGIBILITY.

                  (a) GENERALLY. Executive officers, officers, directors and
employees of the Company, including employees of the Company's Subsidiaries and
Affiliates who are responsible for or contribute to the management, growth
and/or profitability of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries are
eligible to be granted Awards under the Plan.

                  (b) ANNUAL PER-PERSON LIMITATION. Subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided in Sections 5(a) and 5(d), in each calendar year during any
part of which the Plan is in effect, a Participant may be granted Stock Options
relating to no more than 95,000 shares of Stock.

         5.       STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN; ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a) NUMBER OF SHARES. Subject to adjustment as hereinafter
provided, the number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be granted
under the Plan shall be 875,000, and the number of shares of Common Stock which
may be issued in connection with Stock Bonuses, Stock Awards, Restricted Stock
and Restricted Stock Units in lieu of cash or other Stock-Based Awards shall be
425,000, provided however that to the extent that the total number of shares of
Common Stock does not exceed 1,300,000 the Committee may reallocate the split
between the number of shares of Common Stock for which Options may be granted
and the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued in connection with
Stock Bonuses, Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units in lieu
of cash or other Stock-Based Awards. Additionally, subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided the number of shares of Noncumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock, Series B for which Options may be granted and which may be

                                       A-4


<PAGE>



issued in connection with Stock Bonuses, Stock Awards, Restricted Stock and
Restricted Stock Units in lieu of cash or other Stock-Based Awards shall be
375,000.

                  (b) MANNER OF COUNTING SHARES. If any shares subject to an
Award are forfeited, cancelled, exchanged, or surrendered or such Award
otherwise terminates without a distribution of shares to the Participant such
number of shares will again be available for Awards under the Plan. The
Committee may make determinations and adopt regulations for the counting of
shares relating to any Awards to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double
counting (in the case of tandem or substitute awards), and provide for
adjustments in any case in which the number of shares actually distributed
differs from the number of shares previously counted in connection with such
Award.

                  (c) TYPE OF SHARES DISTRIBUTABLE. Any shares of Stock
distributed pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized
and unissued shares or treasury shares, including shares acquired by purchase in
the open market or in private transactions.

                  (d) ADJUSTMENTS. In the event that the Committee shall
determine that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash,
Stock, or other property) which is special, large, and non-recurring,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse split, reorganization, merger,
consolidation, spin-off, combination, repurchase, or share exchange, or other
similar corporate transaction or event, affects the Stock such that an
adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the
rights of Participants under the Plan, then the Committee shall make such
equitable changes or adjustments as it deems appropriate and, in such manner as
it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of shares of
Stock which may thereafter be issued in connection with Awards, (ii) the number
of and kind of shares of Stock issued or issuable in respect of outstanding
Awards or, if deemed appropriate, make provisions for payment of cash or other
property with respect to any outstanding Award, (iii) the per-person limit,
number and kind of shares subject to Options which may be granted pursuant to
Section 4(b) and (iv) the exercise price, grant price, or purchase price
relating to any Award; provided, however, in each case that, with respect to
ISOs, such adjustment shall be made in accordance with Section 424(h) of the
Code, unless the Committee determines otherwise. In addition, the Committee is
authorized to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria
and performance objectives included in Awards, in recognition of unusual or
non-recurring events (including, without limitation, events described in the
preceding sentence, as well as acquisitions and dispositions of businesses and
assets) affecting the Company or any Subsidiary, or business unit, or the
financial statements thereof, or in response to changes in applicable laws,
regulations, accounting principles, tax rates and regulations, or business
conditions or in view of the Committee's assessment of the business strategy of
the Company, a Subsidiary, or business unit thereof, performance of comparable
organizations, economic and business conditions, personal performance of a
Participant, and any other circumstances deemed relevant.

         6.       SPECIFIC TERMS OF AWARDS.

                  (a) GENERAL. Awards may be granted on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Section 6. In addition, the Committee may impose on any Award
or the exercise thereof, at the date of grant or thereafter (subject to Section
9(e)), such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Plan, as the Committee shall determine, including terms
regarding forfeiture of Awards or continued exercisability of Awards in the
event of termination of employment by the Participant.

                  (b) OPTIONS. The Committee is authorized to grant Options to
Participants on the following terms and conditions:

                           (i) EXERCISE PRICE. Unless otherwise required by
         applicable law, the exercise price per share of Stock purchasable under
         an Option shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however,
         that, except as provided in Section 7(a), such exercise price shall be
         not less than the Fair Market Value of a share on the date of grant of
         such Option.

<PAGE>



                           (ii) TIME AND METHOD OF EXERCISE. The Committee shall
         determine at the date of grant or thereafter the time or times at which
         an Option may be exercised in whole or in part, the methods by which
         such exercise price may be paid or deemed to be paid, the form of such
         payment, including, without limitation, cash, Stock, other Awards,
         notes or other property, and the methods by which Stock will be
         delivered or deemed to be delivered to Participants (including, without
         limitation, deferral of delivery of shares under a deferral
         arrangement).

                           (iii) ISOS. The terms of any ISO granted under the
         Plan shall comply in all respects with the provisions of Section 422 of
         the Code.

                  (c) RESTRICTED STOCK. The Committee is authorized to grant
Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units ("RSU") to Participants on the
following terms and conditions:

                           (i) ISSUANCE AND RESTRICTIONS. Restricted Stock and
RSU shall be subject to such

restrictions on transferability and other restrictions, if any, as the committee
may impose at the date of grant or thereafter, which restrictions may lapse
separately or in combination at such times, under such circumstance, in such
installments, or otherwise, as the Committee may determine. Except to the extent
restricted under the Award Agreement relating to the Restricted Stock or RSU, a
Participant granted Restricted Stock or RSU shall have all of the rights of a
stockholder including, without limitation, the right to vote Restricted Stock
and the right to receive dividends thereon.

                           (ii) FORFEITURE. Except as otherwise determined by
the Committee, at the date of grant

or thereafter, upon termination of employment (as determined under criteria
established by the Committee) during the applicable restriction period,
Restricted Stock or RSU, and any accrued but unpaid dividend(s) that is or are
then subject to a risk of forfeiture shall be forfeited; provided, however, that
the Committee may provide, by rule or regulation or in any Award Agreement, or
may determine in any individual case, that restrictions or forfeiture conditions
relating to Restricted Stock or RSU will be waived in whole or in part in the
event of terminations resulting from specified causes, and the Committee may in
other cases waive in whole or in part the forfeiture of Restricted Stock.

                           (iii) CERTIFICATES FOR STOCK. Restricted Stock or RSU
granted under the Plan may be

evidenced in such manner as the Committee shall determine. If certificates
representing Restricted Stock are registered in the name of the participant,
such certificates shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms,
conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock, the Company
shall retain physical possession of the certificate, and the Company may require
the Participant to deliver a stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the
Restricted Stock. Upon expiration of the deferral period specified for RSU by
the Committee (or, if permitted by the Committee, as elected by the participant)
the stock underlying such RSU shall be delivered.

                           (iv) DIVIDENDS. Dividends paid on Restricted Stock or
RSU shall be either paid at the

dividend payment date in cash or in shares of unrestricted Stock having a Fair
Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, or the payment of such
dividends shall be deferred or the amount or value thereof automatically
reinvested in additional Restricted Stock, RSU, other Awards, or other
investment vehicles, as the Committee shall determine or permit the Participant
to elect. Stock distributed in connection with a Stock split or Stock dividend,
and other property distributed as a dividend, shall be subject to restrictions
and a risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Restricted Stock or RSU with
respect to which such Stock or other property has been distributed.

                  (d) STOCK BONUSES AND STOCK AWARDS IN LIEU OF CASH AWARDS. The
Committee is authorized to grant Stock as a bonus, or to grant other Awards, in
lieu of Company commitments to pay cash under other plans or compensatory
arrangements. Stock or Awards granted hereunder shall have such other terms as
shall be determined by the Committee.

                  (e) OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS. The Committee is authorized,
subject to limitations under applicable law, to grant to Participants such other
Awards that may be denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by
reference to, or otherwise based on, or related to, Stock or other securities,
as deemed by the Committee to

                                       A-6


<PAGE>



be consistent with the purposes of the Plan, including, without limitation,
rights convertible or exchangeable into Stock or such securities, purchase
rights for Stock or such other securities, and Awards with value or payment
contingent upon performance of the Company, or a Subsidiary, or upon any other
factor or performance condition designated by the Committee. The Committee is
authorized to make cash awards pursuant to this Section 6(f) as an element of or
supplement to any other Award under the Plan.

         7.       CERTAIN PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO AWARDS.

                  (a) STAND-ALONE, ADDITIONAL, TANDEM AND SUBSTITUTE AWARDS.
Awards granted under the Plan may, in the discretion of the Committee, be
granted either alone or in addition to, in tandem with, or in exchange or
substitution for, any other Award granted under the Plan or any award granted
under any other plan of the Company, any Subsidiary or Affiliate, or any
business entity to be acquired by the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate, or
any other right of a Participant to receive payment from the Company or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate. Awards may be granted in addition to or in tandem with
such other Awards or awards and may be granted either as of the same time as or
a different time from the grant of such other Awards or awards. The per share
exercise price of any Option, or purchase price of any other Award conferring a
right to purchase Stock which is granted, in connection with the substitution of
awards granted under any other plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate or any business entity to be acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary
or Affiliate, shall be determined by the Committee, in its discretion.

                  (b) TERMS OF AWARDS. The term of each Award shall be for such
period as may be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that in no
event shall the term of any ISO exceed a period of ten years from the date of
its grant (or such shorter period as may be applicable under Section 422 of the
Code).

                  (c) FORM OF PAYMENT UNDER AWARDS. Subject to the terms of the
Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, payments to be made by the Company upon
the grant, maturation, or exercise of an Award may be made in such forms as the
Committee shall determine at the date of grant or thereafter, including, without
limitation, cash, Stock, or other property, and may be made in a single payment
or transfer, in installments, or on a deferred basis. The Committee may make
rules relating the installment or deferred payments with respect to Awards,
including the rate of interest to be credited with respect to such payments.

                  (d)      RULE 16B-3 COMPLIANCE.

                           (i) SIX-MONTH HOLDING PERIOD. Unless a Participant
         could otherwise dispose of equity securities, including derivative
         securities, acquired under the Plan without incurring liability under
         Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, equity securities acquired under the
         Plan must be held for a period of six months following the date of such
         acquisition, provided that this condition shall be satisfied with
         respect to a derivative security if at least six months elapse from the
         date of acquisition of the derivative security to the date of
         disposition of the derivative security (other than upon exercise or
         conversion) or its underlying equity security.

                           (ii) OTHER COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS. With respect to a
         Participant who is then subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in
         respect of the Company, the Committee shall implement transactions
         under the Plan and administer the Plan in a manner that will ensure
         that each transaction by such a Participant is exempt from liability
         under Rule 16b-3, except that such a Participant may be permitted to
         engage in a non-exempt transaction under the Plan if written notice has
         been given to the Participant regarding the non-exempt nature of such
         transaction. Unless otherwise specified by the Participant, equity
         securities, including derivative securities, acquired under the Plan
         which are disposed of by a Participant shall be deemed to be disposed
         of in the order acquired by the Participant.

         8.       CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS.

                  (a) ACCELERATION UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL. In the event of a
"Change in Control," as defined in this Section:

                                       A-7


<PAGE>




                           (i) any Award carrying a right to exercise that was
         not previously exercisable and vested shall become fully exercisable
         and vested; and

                           (ii) the restrictions, deferral limitations, and
         forfeiture conditions applicable to any other Award granted under the
         Plan shall lapse and such Awards shall be deemed fully vested, and any
         performance conditions imposed with respect to Awards shall be deemed
         to be fully achieved; provided, however, that, the Board may determine,
         by entry of a resolution prior to the occurrence of a Change in
         Control, that a Change in Control will not result in some or all of the
         consequences specified in (i) or (ii) or will not result in such
         consequences for specified Participants.

                  (b) "CHANGE IN CONTROL" DEFINED. For purposes of the Plan, a
"Change in Control" shall have occurred if:

                           (i) any "person," as such term is used in Sections
         13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company; any
         trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit
         plan of the Company; any corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by
         the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions
         as their ownership of stock of the Company; or any person or group of
         persons who as of the date of approval of this Plan by the Board of
         Directors of the Company owns, directly or indirectly 10% or more of
         the combined voting power of the securities of the Company), is or
         becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
         Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
         representing 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
         then outstanding voting securities;

                           (ii) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger
         or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than
         (A) a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting
         securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto
         continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being
         converted into voting securities of the surviving or parent entity) 50%
         or more of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the
         Company or such surviving or parent entity outstanding immediately
         after such merger or consolidation, or (B) a merger or consolidation
         effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar
         transaction) in which no "person" (as hereinabove defined) acquired 50%
         or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
         securities; or

                           (iii) the stockholders of the Company approve a plan
         of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or
         disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
         assets (or any transaction having a similar effect).

         9.       GENERAL PROVISIONS.

                  (a) COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL AND EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS. The
Company shall not be obligated to take any action under the Plan and any Award
Agreement, unless and until it is satisfied that all applicable federal and
state laws, rules and regulations, and approvals by any regulatory or
governmental agency have been complied with or obtained. The Company, in its
discretion, may postpone the issuance or delivery of Stock under any Award until
completion of such stock exchange listing or registration or qualification of
such Stock or other required action under any state, federal or foreign law,
rule or regulation as the Company may consider appropriate, and may require any
Participant to make such representations and furnish such information as it may
consider appropriate in connection with the issuance or delivery of Stock in
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.

                  (b) NONTRANSFERABILILTY. Except as otherwise provided in this
Section 9(b), Awards shall not be transferable by a Participant other than by
will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to a designation of a
Beneficiary, and Awards shall be exercisable during the lifetime of a
Participant only by such Participant or his guardian or legal representative. In
addition, except as otherwise provided in this Section 9(b), no rights under the
Plan

                                       A-8


<PAGE>



may be pledged, mortgaged, hypothecated, or otherwise encumbered, or subject to
the claims of creditors. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Committee may, in
its sole discretion, provide that Awards (or rights or interests therein) other
than ISOs shall be transferable, including but not limited to permitting
transfers to a Participant's immediate family members (I.E., spouse, children,
or grandchildren, as well as the Participant), to trusts for the benefit of such
family members or other transfers deemed by the Committee to be not inconsistent
with the purposes of the Plan.

                  (c) NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. Neither the Plan nor any
action taken thereunder shall be construed as giving any Participant the right
to be retained in the employ or service of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate any
Participant's employment or services at any time.

                  (d) TAXES. The Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate is
authorized to withhold from any Award granted, any payment relating to an Award
under the Plan, including from a distribution of Stock, or any payroll or other
payment to a Participant, amounts of withholding and other taxes due in
connection with any transaction involving an Award, and to take such other
action as the Committee may deem advisable to enable the Company and
Participants to satisfy obligations for the payment of withholding taxes and
other tax obligations relating to any Award. This authority shall include
authority to withhold or receive Stock or other property and to make cash
payments in respect thereof in satisfaction of a Participant's tax obligations.

                  (e) CHANGES TO THE PLAN AND AWARDS. The Board may amend,
alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate the Plan or the Committee's authority
to grant Awards under the Plan without the consent of stockholders or
Participants, except that any such amendment, alteration, suspension,
discontinuation, or termination shall be subject to the approval of the
Company's stockholders within one year after such Board action if such
stockholder approval is required by any federal law or regulation or the rules
of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Stock may then
be listed or quoted; provided, however, that, without the consent of an affected
Participant, no amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuations, or
termination oft he Plan may materially adversely affect the rights of such
Participant under any Award theretofore granted to him or her. The Committee may
waive any conditions or rights under, or amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or
terminate any Award theretofore granted and any Award Agreement relating
thereto: provided, however, that, without the consent of an affected
Participant, no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation, or
termination of any Award may materially adversely affect the rights of such
Participant under such Awards. Following the occurrence of a Change in Control,
the Board may not terminate this Plan or amend this Plan in any manner adverse
to Participants.

                  (f) NO RIGHT TO AWARDS; NO STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS. No Participant
or employee shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan, and
there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Participants and
employees. No Award shall confer on any Participant any of the rights of a
stockholder of the Company unless and until Stock is duly issued or transferred
to the Participant in accordance with the terms of the Award.

                  (g) UNFUNDED STATUS OF AWARDS AND TRUSTS. The Plan is intended
to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive and deferred compensation. With
respect to any payments not yet made to a Participant pursuant to an Award,
nothing contained in the Plan or any Award shall give any such Participant any
rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company;
provided, however, that the Committee may authorize the creation of trusts or
make other arrangements to meet the Company's obligations under the Plan to
deliver cash, Stock, other Awards, or other property pursuant to any Award,
which trusts or other arrangements shall be consistent with the "unfunded"
status of the Plan unless the Committee otherwise determines with the consent of
each affected Participant. If an to the extent authorized by the Committee, the
Company may deposit into such a trust Stock or other assets for delivery to the
Participant in satisfaction of the Company's obligations under any Award. If so
provided by the Committee, upon such a deposit of Stock or other assets for the
benefit of a Participant, there shall be substituted for the rights of the
Participant to receive delivery of Stock and other payments under the Plan a
right to receive the assets of the trust (to the extent that the deposited Stock
or other assets represented the full amount of the Company's obligation under
the Award at the date of deposit). The trustee of the trust may be authorized to
dispose of trust assets and reinvest the proceeds in alternative investments,
subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify and in
accordance with applicable law.

                                       A-9


<PAGE>


                  (h) NONEXCLUSIVITY OF THE PLAN. Neither the adoption of the
Plan by the Board nor its submission to the stockholders of the Company for
approval shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the
Board to adopt such other incentive arrangements as it may deem desirable,
including without limitation, the granting of stock options and other awards
otherwise than under the Plan, and such arrangements may be either applicable
generally or only in specific cases.

                  (i) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Stock shall
be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall
determine whether cash, other Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid
in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares or any
rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

                  (j) GOVERNING LAW. The validity, construction, and effect of
the Plan, any rules and regulations relating to the Plan, and any Award
Agreement shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the state of
Florida, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws, and
applicable federal law.

                  (k) EFFECTIVE DATE AND APPROVAL DATE; PLAN TERMINATION. The
Plan shall become effective upon approval by the Board of Directors (the
"Effective Date"), provided, however, that the Plan shall be subject to the
subsequent approval by the affirmative votes of the holders of a majority of
voting securities present in person or represented by proxy, and entitled to
vote on the subject matter, at a meeting of Company stockholders duly held in
accordance with the Florida Corporation Code, or any adjournment thereof in
accordance with applicable provisions of the Florida Corporation Code, such
stockholder approval to be obtained not later than one year after the Effective
Date (the "Approval Date"). Any Awards granted under the Plan prior to such
approval of stockholders shall be subject to such approval and in the absence of
such approval, such Awards shall be null and void. Unless earlier terminated by
the Board, the Plan will terminate at such time as the Company has no further
obligations with respect to any Award granted under the Plan; provided, however,
that ISOs may not be granted later than 10 years after the Effective Date..

                  (l) TITLE AND HEADINGS. The titles and headings of the
sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only. In the event of any
conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall
control.

                  SECTION 2. EMPLOYMENT PERIOD; REMAINING UNEXPIRED EMPLOYMENT
PERIOD.

                  (a) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be and
remain in effect during the period of employment established under this section
2 ("Employment Period"). The Employment Period shall be for a term of five years
beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the fifth anniversary date
of this Agreement (each, an "Anniversary Date"), plus such extensions, if any,
as are provided by the Board of Directors of the Company ("Board") pursuant to
section 2(b).

                  (b) Except as provided in section 2(c), beginning on the date
of this Agreement, the Employment Period shall automatically be extended for one
(1) additional day each day, unless either the Company or the Executive elects
not to extend the Agreement further by giving written notice to the other party,
in which case the Employment Period shall end on the fifth anniversary of the
date on which such written notice is given. For all purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Remaining Unexpired Employment Period" as of any date shall mean the
period beginning on such date and ending on: (i) if a notice of non-extension
has been given in accordance with this section 2(b), the fifth anniversary of
the date on which such notice is given; and (ii) in all other cases, the fifth
anniversary of the date as of which the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period is
being determined. Upon termination of the Executive's employment with the
Company for any reason whatsoever, any daily extensions provided pursuant to
this section 2(b), if not therefore discontinued, shall automatically cease.

                  (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company at any time from terminating the Executive's employment during the
Employment Period with or without notice for any reason; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the relative rights and obligations of the Company and the Executive in the
event of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.        DUTIES.

under the By-Laws of the Company and as are customarily associated with such
position. Except as provided in section 7 hereof, the Executive shall devote his
full business time and attention (other than during weekends, holidays, approved
vacation periods, and periods of illness or approved leaves of absence) to the
business and affairs of the Company and shall use his best efforts to advance
the interests of the Company.

                  SECTION 4.        CASH COMPENSATION.

                  In consideration for the services to be rendered by the
Executive hereunder, the Company shall pay to him a salary at an annual rate of
Three Hundred Thousand And 00/100 Dollars ($300,000), payable in approximately
equal installments in accordance with the Company's customary payroll practices
for senior officers. Prior to each Anniversary Date occurring during the
Employment Period, the Board shall review the Executive's annual rate of salary
and may, in its discretion, approve an increase therein. In addition to salary,
the Executive may receive other cash or stock compensation from the Company for
services rendered hereunder at such times, in such amounts and on such terms and
conditions as the Board, in its discretion, may determine from time to time. For
purposes of section 9(b)(iv), the term "Salary" shall mean the aggregate value
of the annual rate of cash compensation and the fair market value, determined at

                  (b) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law,
during the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, the
Company shall indemnify the Executive against and hold him harmless from any

director or officer of the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof.

                  SECTION 7.        OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES.

                  During the Employment Period, it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement and shall not permit the Company to terminate the Executive's
employment for Cause if the Executive engages in the activities described below
or any activities similar in nature and scope, so long as such activities do not
significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities
in accordance with this Agreement and do not constitute a violation of any
applicable law, rule, regulation or code of conduct or policy established by the
Company and applicable to similarly situated executives: (i) engaging in the
practice of law, including, without limitation, as a member of the firm of
Stuzin and Camner, Professional Association, (ii) serving on industry,
corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (iii) managing personal
investments (including, without limitation, family-controlled enterprises), or
(iv) investing in, advising or serving as an officer or director of other
corporations or business entities. It is expressly understood and agreed that to
the extent any such activities have been conducted by the Executive prior to the
date of this Agreement, the continued conduct of such activities (or the conduct
of activities similar in nature and scope) shall not thereafter be deemed to
interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities to the
Company. The Executive may also serve as an officer or director of the Bank on
such terms and conditions as the Company and the Bank may mutually agree upon,
and such service shall not be deemed to materially interfere with the
Executive's performance of his duties hereunder or otherwise result in a
material breach of this Agreement. If the Executive is discharged or suspended,
or is subject to any regulatory prohibition or restriction with respect to
participation in the affairs of the Bank, he shall continue to perform services
for the Company in accordance with this Agreement but shall not directly or
indirectly provide services to or participate in the affairs of the Bank in a
manner inconsistent with the terms of such discharge or suspension or any
applicable regulatory order.

                  SECTION 8.        WORKING FACILITIES AND EXPENSES.

location within Coral Gables at which the Company shall maintain its principal
executive offices, or at such other location as the Company and the Executive
may mutually agree upon. The Company shall provide the Executive at his
principal place of employment with a private office, secretarial services and
other support services and facilities including, but not limited to, Internet
and Bloomberg Financial Market Commodities and News Access Subscriptions,
cellular telephones, pagers and a lap-top computer, suitable to his position
with the Company and necessary or appropriate in connection with the per-

formance of his assigned duties under this Agreement. The Company shall provide
to the Executive for his exclusive use an automobile owned or leased by the
Company which shall be a BMW 740 (or an automobile of similar stature and
caliber), to be used in the performance of his duties hereunder, including
commuting to and from his personal residence. The Company shall reimburse the
Executive for his ordinary and necessary business expenses, including, without
limitation, all expenses associated with his business use of the aforementioned
automobile, fees for memberships in such clubs and organizations as the
Executive and the Company shall mutually agree are necessary and appropriate for
business purposes, and his travel and entertainment expenses incurred in
connection with the performance of his duties under this Agreement, in each case
upon presentation to the Company of an itemized account of such expenses in such
form as the Company may reasonably require.

                  SECTION 9. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH SEVERANCE BENEFITS.

                  (a) The Executive shall be entitled to the severance benefits

                  Company;

                           (B) the failure of the stockholders of the Company to
                  elect or re-elect the Executive or the failure of the Board
                  (or the nominating committee thereof) to nominate the
                  Executive for such election or re-election;

                           (C) the expiration of a thirty (30) day period
                  following the date on which the Executive gives written notice

                  of the Company's Charter or By-laws, action of the Board or
                  the Company's stockholders or otherwise, to vest in the

                  or covenant contained in this Agreement (including, without
                  limitation any reduction of the Executive's rate of base
                  salary in effect from time to time and any change in the terms
                  and conditions of any compensation or benefit program in which
                  the Executive participates which, either individually or

                  failure in a manner determined by the Executive, in his
                  discretion, to be satisfactory; or

                           (E) the relocation of the executive offices of the

                  (ii) subject to the provisions of section 10, the termination
         of the Executive's employment by the Company for any other reason;

then, the Company shall provide the benefits and pay to the Executive the
amounts described in section 9(b).

                  (b) Upon the termination of the Executive's employment with
the Company under circumstances described in section 9(a) of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay and provide to the Executive (or, in the event of his death
following such termination of employment to his estate):

                  (i) his earned but unpaid compensation (including, without
         limitation, all items which constitute wages under applicable state law
         and the payment of which is not otherwise provided for under this
         section 9(b)) as of the date of the termination of his employment with
         the Company, such payment to be made at the time and in the manner
         prescribed by law applicable to the payment of wages but in no event

         addition to that provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii), and after
         taking into account the coverage provided by any subsequent employer,
         if and to the extent necessary to provide for the Executive, for the
         Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, coverage equivalent to the
         coverage to which he would have been entitled under such plans (as in
         effect on the date of his termination of employment, or, if his
         termination of employment occurs after a Change in Control, on the date
         of such Change in Control, whichever benefits are greater), if he had
         continued working for the Company or the Bank, as applicable during the
         Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of
         compensation achieved during that portion of the Employment Period
         which is prior to the Executive's termination of employment with the
         Company and with such continued coverages to be provided to the

         policy or policies;

                  (iv) within thirty (30) days following his termination of
         employment with the Company, a lump sum payment, in an amount equal to
         the present value of the Salary that the Executive would have earned if
         he had continued working for the Company or the Bank, as applicable
         during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual
         Salary achieved during that portion of the Employment Period which is
         prior to the Executive's termination of employment with the Company or
         the Bank, as applicable, where such present value is to be determined

         prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
         ("Code"), compounded using the compounding period corresponding to the
         regular payroll periods of the Company or the Bank, as applicable for
         its officers, such lump sum to be paid in lieu of all other payments of
         Salary provided for under this Agreement in respect of the period
         following any such termination;

                  (v) within thirty (30) days following his termination of
         employment with the Company, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to
         the excess, if any, of:

                           (A) the present value of the aggregate benefits to
                  which he would be entitled under any and all qualified and
                  non-qualified defined benefit pension plans maintained by, or
                  covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, as applicable,
                  if he were 100% vested thereunder and had continued working
                  for the Company or the Bank, as applicable during the
                  Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, such benefits to be
                  determined as of the date of termination of employment by
                  adding to the service actually recognized under such plans an
                  additional period equal to the Remaining Unexpired Employment
                  Period and by adding to the compensation recognized under such
                  plans for the year in which termination of employment occurs
                  all amounts payable under sections 9(b)(i), (iv), (vii),
                  (viii) and (ix); over

                           (B) the present value of the benefits to which he is
                  actually entitled under such defined benefit pension plans as
                  of the date of his termination;

         where such present values are to be determined using the mortality
         tables prescribed under section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code and a
         discount rate, compounded monthly equal to the annualized rate of
         interest prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the
         valuation of immediate annuities payable under terminating
         single-employer defined benefit plans for the month in which the
         Executive's termination of employment occurs ("Applicable PBGC Rate");

                  (vi) within thirty (30) days following his termination of
         employment with the Company, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to
         the present value of the additional

                                    Page 7 of 19

         and all qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans
         maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, as
         applicable, if he were 100% vested thereunder and had continued working
         for the Company or the Bank, as applicable during the Remaining
         Unexpired Employment Period at the highest annual rate of compensation
         achieved during that portion of the Employment Period which is prior to
         the Executive's termination of employment with the Company, and making
         the maximum amount of employee contributions, if any, required under
         such plan or plans, such present value to be determined on the basis of
         a discount rate, compounded using the compounding period that
         corresponds to the frequency with which employer contributions are made
         to the relevant plan, equal to the Applicable PBGC Rate;

                  (vii) the payments that would have been made to the Executive
         under any cash bonus or long-term or short-term cash incentive
         compensation plan maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company
         or the Bank, as applicable if he had continued working for the Company
         or the Bank, as applicable during the Remaining Unexpired Employment
         Period and had earned the maximum bonus or incentive award in each
         calendar year that ends during the Remaining Unexpired Employment
         Period, such payments to be equal to the product of:

                           (A) the maximum percentage rate at which an award was
                  ever available to the Executive under such incentive
                  compensation plan; multiplied by

                           (B) the salary that would have been paid to the
                  Executive during each such calendar year at the highest annual

                  Period which is prior to the Executive's termination of
                  employment with the Company:

         such payments to be made (without discounting for early payment) within
         thirty (30) days following the Executive's termination of employment;

                  (viii) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30)
         days following his termination of employment with the Company, upon the
         surrender of options or appreciation rights issued to the Executive
         under any stock option and appreciation rights plan or program
         maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company or the Bank, as
         applicable, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of:

                           (A) the excess of (I) the fair market value of a
                  share of stock of the same class as the stock subject to the
                  option or appreciation right, determined as of the date of
                  termination of employment, over (II) the exercise price per

         For purposes of this section 9(b)(viii) and for purposes of determining
         the Executive's right following his termination of employment with the
         Company to exercise any options or appreciation rights not surrendered
         pursuant hereto, the Executive shall be deemed fully vested in all
         options and appreciation rights under any stock option or appreciation
         rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees of, the
         Company, even if he is not vested under such plan or program;

                  (ix) at the election of the Company made within thirty (30)
         days following the Executive's termination of employment with the
         Company, upon the surrender of any shares awarded to the Executive
         under any restricted stock plan maintained by, or covering employees
         of, the Company or the Bank, as applicable, a lump sum payment in an

                  same class of stock granted under such plan, determined as of
                  the date of the Executive's termination of employment;
                  multiplied by

                           (B) the number of shares which are being surrendered.

         For purposes of this section 9(b)(ix) and for purposes of determining

         immediately prior to his termination of employment.

The Company and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are not
capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and that the
payments and benefits contemplated by this section


                                    Page 9 of 19

Executive's efforts, if any, to mitigate damages. The Company and the Executive
further agree that the Company may condition the payments and benefits (if any)
due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (x) on the receipt of
the Executive's resignation from any and all positions which he holds as an
officer, director or committee member with respect to the Company, the Bank or

foregoing provisions of this section 9(b) entitle the Executive to additional
grants of statutory or non-statutory options to purchase shares of common stock

                  SECTION 10. TERMINATION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL COMPANY LIABILITY.

                  (a) In the event that the Executive's employment with the
Company shall terminate during the Employment Period on account of:

                  (i) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for

         engages in dishonest conduct in connection with his performance of
         services for the Company resulting in his conviction of a felony; (B)
         the Executive is convicted of, or pleads guilty or NOLO CONTENDERE to,
         a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude; (C) the Executive
         willfully fails or refuses to perform his duties under this Agreement
         and fails to cure such breach within sixty (60) days following written
         notice thereof from the Company; (D) the Executive breaches his
         fiduciary duties to the Company for personal profit; or (E) the
         Executive's willful breach or violation of any law, rule or regulation

         desist order in connection with his performance of services for the
         Company; or

                  (ii) the Executive's voluntary resignation from employment
         with the Company for reasons other than those specified in section
         9(a);

then, the Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, other

of his earned but unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his
employment, and the provision of such other benefits, if any, to which he is
entitled as a former employee under the employee benefit plans and programs and
compensation plans and programs maintained by, or covering employees of, the
Company.

                  (b) For purposes of section 10(a)(i)(A) or (B), no act or
failure to act, on the part of the Executive, shall be considered "willful"
unless it is done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in bad faith or
without reasonable belief that the Executive's action or omission was in the
best interests of the Company. Any act, or failure to act, based upon authority
given pursuant to a resolution duly adopted by the Board or based upon the
written advice of counsel for the Company shall be conclusively presumed to be
done, or omitted to be done, by the Executive in good faith and in the best
interests of the Company. The cessation of employment of the

Executive shall not be deemed to be for "cause" within the meaning of section
10(a)(i) unless and until there shall have been delivered to the Executive a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of three-fourths of
the non-employee members of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held
for such purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the
Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before the
Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive is
guilty of the conduct described in section 10(a)(i) above, and specifying the
particulars thereof in detail.

                  SECTION 11. TERMINATION UPON OR FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

                  (a) A Change in Control of the Company ("Change in Control")
shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following
events:

                  (i) approval by the stockholders of the Company of a
         transaction that would result in the reorganization, merger or
         consolidation of the Company, respectively, with one or more other
         persons, other than a transaction following which:

                           (A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of
                  the entity resulting from such transaction are beneficially
                  owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
                  Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions
                  by persons who, immediately prior to such transaction,
                  beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
                  promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
                  outstanding equity ownership interests in the Company; and

                           (B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote
                  generally in the election of directors of the entity resulting
                  from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the
                  meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in
                  substantially the same relative proportions by persons who,
                  immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned
                  (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
                  Exchange Act) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote
                  generally in the election of directors of the Company;

                  (ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets
         of the Company or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule
         13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the
         outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
         election of directors by any person or by any persons acting in
         concert, or approval by the stockholders of the Company of any
         transaction which would result in such an acquisition;

                  (iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or
         approval by the stockholders of the Company of a plan for such
         liquidation or dissolution;

                  (iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following
         such event, at least 50% of the members of the board of directors of
         the Company do not belong to any of the following groups:

                           (A) individuals who were members of the Board of the
                  Company on the date of this Agreement; or

                           (B) individuals who first became members of the Board
                  of the Company after the date of this Agreement either:

                                    (I) upon election to serve as a member of
                           the Board of directors of the Company by affirmative
                           vote of three-quarters of the members of such board,
                           or of a nominating committee thereof, in office at
                           the time of such first election; or

                                    (II) upon election by the stockholders of
                           the Board to serve as a member of the board of
                           directors of the Board, but only if nominated for
                           election by affirmative vote of three-quarters of the
                           members of the board of directors of the Board, or of
                           a nominating committee thereof, in office at the time
                           of such first nomination;

                  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such individual's election or
                  nomination did not result from an actual or threatened
                  election contest (within the meaning of Rule 14a-11 of
                  Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other
                  actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents
                  (within the meaning of Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A
                  promulgated under the Exchange Act) other than by or on behalf
                  of the Board of the Company; or

                  (v) any event which would be described in section 11(a)(i),
         (ii), (iii) or (iv) if the term "Bank" were substituted for the term
         "Company" therein.

In no event, however, shall a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred as a
result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a subsidiary of
either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them. For
purposes of this section 11(a), the term "person" shall have the meaning
assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.

                  (b) In the event of a Change in Control, the Executive shall
be entitled to the payments and benefits contemplated by section 9(b) in the
event of his termination of employment with the Company under any of the
circumstances described in section 9(a) of this Agreement or under any of the
following circumstances:


                                   Page 12 of 19


<PAGE>



                  (i) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period following his demotion, loss of
         title, office or significant authority or responsibility, or following
         any reduction in any element of his package of compensation and
         benefits;

                  (ii) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period following any relocation of his
         principal place of employment or any change in working conditions at
         such principal place of employment which the Executive, in his
         reasonable discretion, determines to be embarrassing, derogatory or
         otherwise adverse;

                  (iii) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period following the failure of any
         successor to the Company in the Change in Control to include the
         Executive in any compensation or benefit program maintained by it or
         covering any of its executive officers, unless the Executive is already
         covered by a substantially similar plan of the Company which is at
         least as favorable to him; or

                  (iv) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, for any reason
         whatsoever following the effective date of the Change in Control.

                  SECTION 12. TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO DEATH OR
DISABILITY.

                  (a) In the event that the Executive's employment with the
Company shall terminate during the Employment Period on account of:

                  (i)      the Executive's death; or

                  (ii) a determination that the Executive is eligible for
         long-term disability benefits under the Company's long-term disability
         insurance program or, if there is no such program, under the federal
         Social Security Act;

then, subject to the provisions of subsection 12(b) and the next immediately
succeeding sentence, to be applicable in the event of the Executive's death, the
Company shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, other than the
payment to the Executive (or, in the event of his death, to his estate) of his
earned but unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his employment,
and the provision of such other benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a
former employee under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation
plans and programs maintained by, or covering employees of, the Company. In the
event of the Executive's death, the payments and benefits described in sections
9(b)(ii), 9(b)(iii) and 9(b)(x)(A), (B) and (C) hereof shall be provided to the
Executive's surviving spouse.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 12(a) hereof,
in the event a Change in Control (as defined in section 11 of this Agreement)
occurs within eighteen (18) months


                                   Page 13 of 19


<PAGE>



following the effective date of the Executive's termination of employment with
the Company due to his death or disability, the Executive (or his estate, in the
event of his death) shall be entitled to receive the payments and benefits that
would have been paid to the Executive pursuant to section 9(b) of this Agreement
assuming the Executive's employment with the Company had terminated following
the date such Change in Control occurs; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, the Company's
obligations under this section 12(b) shall be offset by any compensation,
benefits or perquisites previously provided to the Executive's surviving spouse
pursuant to section 12(a) hereof as a result of the Executive's death during the
Employment Period. For purposes of the compensation, benefits or perquisites to
be provided to the Executive pursuant to section 9(b) of this Agreement, the
Executive's "employment termination date" shall be the date immediately
following the date such Change in Control occurs and any elections permitted to
be made by the Executive pursuant to section 9(b) may be made by the Executive
or his legally appointed representative, whatever the case may be.

                  SECTION 13.       TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) This section 13 shall apply if the Executive's employment
is terminated upon or following (i) a Change in Control (as defined in section
11 of this Agreement); or (ii) a change "in the ownership or effective control"
of the Company or the Bank or "in the ownership of a substantial portion of the
assets" of the Company or the Bank within the meaning of section 280G of the
Code. If this section 13 applies, then, if for any taxable year, the Executive
shall be liable for the payment of an excise tax under section 4999 of the Code
with respect to any payment in the nature of compensation made by the Company,
the Bank or any direct or indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or the
Bank to (or for the benefit of) the Executive, the Company shall pay to the
Executive an amount equal to X determined under the following formula:

                  X   =          E x P
                    ------------------------------------
                    1 - [(FI x (1 - SLI)) + SLI + E + M]

                  where

                  E =      the rate at which the excise tax is assessed under 
                           section 4999 of the Code;

                  P =      the amount with respect to which such excise tax is
                           assessed, determined without regard to this section
                           13;

                  FI =     the highest marginal rate of income tax applicable 
                           to the Executive under the Code for the taxable year 
                           in question;


                                   Page 14 of 19


<PAGE>



                  SLI=     the sum of the highest marginal rates of income tax
                           applicable to the Executive under all applicable
                           state and local laws for the taxable year in
                           question; and

                  M =      the highest marginal rate of Medicare tax
                           applicable to the Executive under the Code for the
                           taxable year in question.

With respect to any payment in the nature of compensation that is made to (or
for the benefit of) the Executive under the terms of this Agreement, or
otherwise, and on which an excise tax under section 4999 of the Code will be
assessed, the payment determined under this section 13(a) shall be made to the
Executive on the earlier of (i) the date the Company, the Bank or any direct or
indirect subsidiary or affiliate of the Company or the Bank is required to
withhold such tax, or (ii) the date the tax is required to be paid by the
Executive.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything in this section 13 to the
contrary, in the event that the Executive's liability for the excise tax under
section 4999 of the Code for a taxable year is subsequently determined to be
different than the amount determined by the formula (X + P) x E, where X, P and
E have the meanings provided in section 13(a), the Executive or the Company, as
the case may be, shall pay to the other party at the time that the amount of
such excise tax is finally determined, an appropriate amount, plus interest,
such that the payment made under section 13(a), when increased by the amount of
the payment made to the Executive under this section 13(b) by the Company, or
when reduced by the amount of the payment made to the Company under this section
13(b) by the Executive, equals the amount that should have properly been paid to
the Executive under section 13(a). The interest paid under this section 13(b)
shall be determined at the rate provided under section 1274(b)(2)(B) of the
Code. To confirm that the proper amount, if any, was paid to the Executive under
this section 13, the Executive shall furnish to the Company a copy of each tax
return which reflects a liability for an excise tax payment made by the Company,
at least 20 days before the date on which such return is required to be filed
with the Internal Revenue Service.

                  SECTION 14.       NO EFFECT ON EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS OR 
PROGRAMS.

                  The termination of the Executive's employment during the term
of this Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Company or by the Executive,
shall have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under
the Company's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings, thrift,
profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs, or
compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover employees of,
the Company from time to time.

                  SECTION 15.       SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.


                                   Page 15 of 19


<PAGE>



                  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Executive, his legal representatives and testate or intestate
distributees, and the Company and its successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other person
or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets and
business of the Company may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of the
Company to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the
Company's obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the
scheduled effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material
breach of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 16.       NOTICES.

                  Any communication required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement, including any notice, direction, designation, consent, instruction,
objection or waiver, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given

mailed, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, addressed to such party at the address listed below or at such other

                  SECTION 17.       INDEMNIFICATION FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES.

                  The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and defend the
Executive against rea sonable costs, including legal fees, incurred by him in
connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may
be involved, as a result of his efforts, in good faith, to defend or enforce the
terms of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Executive shall have
substantially prevailed on the merits pursuant to a judgment, decree or order of
a court of competent jurisdiction or of an arbitrator in an arbitration
proceeding, or in a settlement. For purposes of this Agreement, any settlement
agreement which provides for payment of any amounts in settlement of the
Company's obligations hereunder shall be conclusive evidence of the Executive's
entitlement to indemnification hereunder, and any such indemnification payments
shall be in addition to amounts payable pursuant to such settlement agreement,
unless such settlement agreement expressly provides otherwise.

                  SECTION 18.       SEVERABILITY.

                  A determination that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision hereof.

                  SECTION 19.       WAIVER.
                               
                  Failure to insist upon strict compliance with any of the
terms, covenants or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver of such term,
covenant, or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made
in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

                  SECTION 20.       COUNTERPARTS.

                  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more

in accordance with the federal laws of the United States and, to the extent that
federal law is inapplicable, in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida
applicable to contracts entered into and to be performed entirely within the
State of Florida.

                  SECTION 22.       HEADINGS AND CONSTRUCTION.

                  The headings of sections in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and are not intended to qualify the meaning of any section.
Any reference to a section number shall refer to a section of this Agreement,

                  This instrument contains the entire agreement of the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes in its entirety any and
all prior agreements, understandings or representations relating to the subject
matter hereof. No modifications of this Agreement shall be valid unless made in

                  SECTION 24.       GUARANTEE.

                  The Company hereby agrees to guarantee the payment by the Bank
of any benefits and compensation to which the Executive is or may be entitled to
under the terms and conditions of the employment agreement dated effective as of
the 14th day of November, 1997 between the Bank and the Executive, a copy of

                  SECTION 2. EMPLOYMENT PERIOD; REMAINING UNEXPIRED EMPLOYMENT
PERIOD.

                  (a) The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be and
remain in effect during the period of employment established under this section
2 ("Employment Period"). The Employment Period shall be for a term of three
years beginning on the date of this Agreement. Prior to the first anniversary of
the date of this Agreement and on or prior to each anniversary date thereafter
(each, an "Anniversary Date"), the Board of Directors of the Bank ("Board")
shall review the terms of this Agreement and the Executive's performance of
services hereunder and may, in the absence of objection from the Executive,
approve an extension of the Employment Agreement. In such event, the Employment

Unexpired Employment Period" as of any date shall mean the period beginning on
such date and ending on the Anniversary Date on which the Employment Period (as
extended pursuant to section 2(a) of this Agreement) is then scheduled to
expire.

                  (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the
Bank at any time from terminating the Executive's employment during the
Employment Period with or without notice for any reason; provided, however, that
the relative rights and obligations of the Bank and the Executive in the event
of any such termination shall be determined under this Agreement.

of the Bank.

                  SECTION 4.        ANNUAL COMPENSATION.

                  In consideration for the services to be rendered by the

Period, the Board shall review the Executive's annual rate of salary and may, in
its discretion, approve an increase therein. In addition to salary, the
Executive may receive other cash from the Bank for services rendered hereunder
at such times, in such amounts and on such terms and conditions as the Board, in
its discretion, may determine from time to time. For purposes of section
9(b)(iv), the term "Salary" shall mean the aggregate value of the annual rate


                                    Page 2 of 17


<PAGE>

of the stock compensation paid to the Executive pursuant to this section 4
hereof.

                  SECTION 5.        EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND PROGRAMS.

                  During the Employment Period, the Executive shall be treated
as an employee of the Bank and shall be entitled to participate in and receive
benefits under any and all qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension,
savings, profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, any and all group life, health
(including hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and
long term disability insurance plans, and any other employee benefit and
compensation plans (including, but not limited to, any incentive compensation

situated executives of, the Bank, in accordance with the terms and conditions of
such employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans and programs and

                  (a) During the Employment Period and for a period of six (6)
years thereafter, the Bank shall cause the Executive to be covered by and named
as an insured under any policy or contract of insurance obtained by it to insure
its directors and officers against personal liability for acts or omissions in
connection with service as an officer or director of the Bank or service in
other capacities at the request of the Bank. The coverage provided to the
Executive pursuant to this section 6 shall be of the same scope and on the same
terms and conditions as the coverage (if any) provided to other officers or
directors of the Bank.

                  (b) To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law,
during the Employment Period and for a period of six (6) years thereafter, the
Bank shall indemnify the Executive against and hold him harmless from any costs,
liabilities, losses and exposures to the fullest extent and on the most
favorable terms and conditions that similar indemnification is offered to any

                  SECTION 7.        OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES.

                  During the Employment Period, it shall not be a violation of
this Agreement and shall not permit the Bank to terminate the Executive's
employment for Cause if the Executive engages in the activities described below
or any activities similar in nature and scope, so long as such activities do not
significantly interfere with the performance of the Executive's responsibilities
in accordance with this Agreement and do not constitute a violation of any
applicable law, rule, regulation or code of conduct or policy established by the
Bank and applicable to similarly situated executives: (i) engaging in the
practice of law, including, without limitation, as a member of the firm of
Stuzin and Camner, Professional Association, (ii) serving

on industry, corporate, civic or charitable boards or committees, (iii) managing
personal investments (including, without limitation, family-controlled
enterprises), or (iv) investing in, advising or serving as an officer or
director of other corporations or business entities. It is expressly understood
and agreed that to the extent any such activities have been conducted by the
Executive prior to the date of this Agreement, the continued conduct of such
activities (or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope) shall not
thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's
responsibilities to the Bank. The Executive may also serve as an officer or
director of the Company on such terms and conditions as the Bank and the Company
may mutually agree upon, and such service shall not be deemed to materially
interfere with the Executive's performance of his duties hereunder or otherwise
result in a material breach of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.        WORKING FACILITIES AND EXPENSES.

                  The Executive's principal place of employment shall be at the

account of such expenses in such form as the Bank may reasonably require.

                  Executive for such election or re-election;

                           (C) the expiration of a thirty (30) day period
                  following the date on which the Executive gives written notice

                  the Bank's Organization Certificate or By-laws, action of the
                  Board or the Bank's stockholders or otherwise, to vest in the
                  Executive the functions, duties, or responsibilities
                  prescribed in section 3 of this Agreement, unless, during such

                  limitation any reduction of the Executive's rate of base
                  salary in effect from time to time and any change in the terms
                  and conditions of any compensation or benefit program in which
                  the Executive participates which, either individually or
                  together with other changes, has a material adverse effect on
                  the aggregate value of his total compensation package),

         addition to that provided pursuant to section 9(b)(ii), and after
         taking into account the coverage provided by any subsequent employer,

         termination of employment occurs after a Change in Control, on the date
         of such Change in Control, whichever benefits are greater), if he had
         continued working for the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
         Employment Period at the highest annual rate of compensation achieved
         during that portion of the Employment Period which is prior to the
         Executive's termination of employment with the Bank and with such
         continued coverages to be provided to the Executive at the Bank's

         present value of the Salary that the Executive would have earned if he
         had continued working for the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
         Employment Period at the highest annual Salary achieved during that
         portion of the Employment Period which is prior to the Executive's
         termination of employment with the Bank, where such present value is to
         be determined using a discount rate equal to the applicable short-term
         federal rate prescribed under section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue
         Code of 1986 ("Code"), compounded using the compounding period
         corresponding to the Bank's regular payroll periods for its officers,
         such lump sum to be paid in lieu of all other payments of Salary
         provided for under this Agreement in respect of the period following
         any such termination;

                  non-qualified defined benefit pension plans maintained by, or
                  covering employees of, the Bank, if he were 100% vested
                  thereunder and had continued working for the Bank during the
                  Remaining


                                    Page 6 of 17


<PAGE>



                  Unexpired Employment Period, such benefits to be determined as
                  of the date of termination of employment by adding to the
                  service actually recognized under such plans an additional
                  period equal to the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period and
                  by adding to the compensation recognized under such plans for
                  the year in which termination of employment occurs all amounts
                  payable under sections 9(b)(i), (iv), (vii), (viii) and (ix);
                  over

                           (B) the present value of the benefits to which he is
                  actually entitled under such defined benefit pension plans as
                  of the date of his termination;

         where such present values are to be determined using the mortality
         tables prescribed under section 415(b)(2)(E)(v) of the Code and a
         discount rate, compounded monthly equal to the annualized rate of
         interest prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for the
         valuation of immediate annuities payable under terminating
         single-employer defined benefit plans for the month in which the
         Executive's termination of employment occurs ("Applicable PBGC Rate");

                  (vi) within thirty (30) days following his termination of
         employment with the Bank, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the
         present value of the additional employer contributions to which he
         would have been entitled under any and all qualified and non-qualified
         defined contribution plans maintained by, or covering employees of, the
         Bank, if he were 100% vested thereunder and had continued working for
         the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period at the
         highest annual rate of compensation achieved during that portion of the
         Employment Period which is prior to the Executive's termination of
         employment with the Bank, and making the maximum amount of employee
         contributions, if any, required under such plan or plans, such present
         value to be determined on the basis of a discount rate, compounded
         using the compounding period that corresponds to the frequency with
         which employer contributions are made to the relevant plan, equal to
         the Applicable PBGC Rate;

                  (vii) the payments that would have been made to the Executive
         under any cash bonus or long-term or short-term cash incentive
         compensation plan maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank if
         he had continued working for the Bank during the Remaining Unexpired
         Employment Period and had earned the maximum bonus or incentive award
         in each calendar year that ends during the Remaining Unexpired
         Employment Period, such payments to be equal to the product of:

                           (A) the maximum percentage rate at which an award was
                  ever available to the Executive under such incentive
                  compensation plan; multiplied by

                           (B) the salary that would have been paid to the
                  Executive during each such calendar year at the highest annual
                  rate of salary achieved during that portion

                  of the Employment Period which is prior to the Executive's
                  termination of employment with the Bank:

         such payments to be made (without discounting for early payment) within
         thirty (30) days following the Executive's termination of employment;

                  (viii) at the election of the Bank made within thirty (30)
         days following his termination of employment with the Bank, upon the
         surrender of options or appreciation rights issued to the Executive
         under any stock option and appreciation rights plan or program
         maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank, a lump sum payment
         in an amount equal to the product of:

                           (A) the excess of (I) the fair market value of a
                  share of stock of the same class as the stock subject to the
                  option or appreciation right, determined as of the date of
                  termination of employment, over (II) the exercise price per
                  share for such option or appreciation right, as specified in
                  or under the relevant plan or program; multiplied by

                           (B) the number of shares with respect to which
                  options or appreciation rights are being surrendered.

         For purposes of this section 9(b)(viii) and for purposes of determining
         the Executive's right following his termination of employment with the
         Bank to exercise any options or appreciation rights not surrendered
         pursuant hereto, the Executive shall be deemed fully vested in all
         options and appreciation rights under any stock option or appreciation
         rights plan or program maintained by, or covering employees of, the
         Bank, even if he is not vested under such plan or program;

                  (ix) at the election of the Bank made within thirty (30) days
         following the Executive's termination of employment with the Bank, upon
         the surrender of any shares awarded to the Executive under any
         restricted stock plan maintained by, or covering employees of, the
         Bank, a lump sum payment in an amount equal to the product of:

                           (A) the fair market value of a share of stock of the
                  same class of stock granted under such plan, determined as of
                  the date of the Executive's termination of employment;
                  multiplied by

                           (B) the number of shares which are being surrendered.

         For purposes of this section 9(b)(ix) and for purposes of determining
         the Executive's right following his termination of employment with the
         Bank to any stock not surrendered pursuant hereto, the Executive shall
         be deemed fully vested


                                    Page 8 of 17


<PAGE>



         in all shares awarded under any restricted stock plan maintained by, or
         covering employees of, the Bank, even if he is not vested under such
         plan.

                  (x) In addition, the Bank shall provide the Executive with (A)
         personal use, at the Bank expense for the Remaining Unexpired
         Employment Period, of a late model automobile comparable to that used
         by the Executive prior to his termination of employment; (B) the right
         of the Executive to purchase, at book value, the membership in up to
         two country clubs which the Bank has maintained for the benefit of the
         Executive; (C) the transfer to the Executive of two $1 million life
         insurance policies that the Bank then maintains on the life of the
         Executive as part of his benefits; and (D) continued use, at the Bank
         expense for the Remaining Unexpired Employment Period, of the
         secretarial services, Internet and Bloomberg Financial Market
         Commodities and News Access Subscriptions, cellular telephones, pagers
         and the lap-top computer which had been provided to the Executive
         immediately prior to his termination of employment.

The Bank and the Executive hereby stipulate that the damages which may be
incurred by the Executive following any such termination of employment are not
capable of accurate measurement as of the date first above written and that the
payments and benefits contemplated by this section 9(b) constitute reasonable
damages under the circumstances and shall be payable without any requirement of
proof of actual damage and without regard to the Executive's efforts, if any, to
mitigate damages. The Bank and the Executive further agree that the Bank may
condition the payments and benefits (if any) due under sections 9(b)(iii), (iv),
(v), (vi), (vii) and (x) on the receipt of the Executive's resignation from any
and all positions which he holds as an officer, director or committee member
with respect to the Bank, the Bank or any subsidiary or affiliate of either of
them. In no event shall any of the foregoing provisions of this section 9(b)
entitle the Executive to additional grants of statutory or non-statutory options
to purchase shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to any incentive
stock option plan, then in effect.

                  SECTION 10. TERMINATION WITHOUT ADDITIONAL BANK LIABILITY.

                  In the event that the Executive's employment with the Bank
shall terminate during the Employment Period on account of:

                  (a) the discharge of the Executive for "cause," which, for
purposes of this Agreement shall mean personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful
misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional
failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule or
regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease
and desist order, or any material breach of this Agreement, in each case as
measured against standards generally prevailing at the relevant time in the
savings and community banking industry; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Executive
shall not be deemed to have been discharged for cause unless and until the
following procedures shall have been followed:


                                    Page 9 of 17

                  (i) the Board shall adopt a resolution duly approved by
         affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board at a meeting called
         and held for such purpose calling for the Executive's termination for
         cause and setting forth the purported grounds for such termination
         ("Proposed Termination Resolution");

                  (ii) as soon as practicable, and in any event within five (5)
         days, after adoption of such resolution, the Board shall furnish to the
         Executive a written notice of termination which shall be accompanied by
         a certified copy of the Proposed Termination Resolution ("Notice of
         Proposed Termination");

                  (iii) the Executive shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity
         to make oral and written presentations to the members of the Board, on
         his own behalf, or through a representative, who may be his legal
         counsel, to refute the grounds set forth in the Proposed Termination
         Resolution at one or more meetings of the Board to be held no sooner
         than fifteen (15) days and no later than thirty (30) days after the
         Executive's receipt of the Proposed Termination Notice ("Termination
         Hearings"); and

                  (iv) within ten (10) days following the end of the Termination
         Hearings, the Board shall adopt a resolution duly approved by
         affirmative vote of a majority of the entire Board at a meeting called
         and held for such purpose (A) finding that in the good faith opinion of
         the Board the grounds for termination set forth in the Proposed
         Termination Resolution exist and (B) terminating the Executive's
         employment ("Termination Resolution"); and

                  (v) as promptly as practicable, and in any event within one
         (1) business day after adoption of the Termination Resolution, the
         Board shall furnish to the Executive written notice of termination,
         which notice shall include a copy of the Termination Resolution and
         specify an effective date of termination that is not later than the
         date on which such notice is given;

                  (b) The Executive's voluntary resignation from employment with
the Bank for reasons other than those specified in section 9(a)(i);

                  (c)      The Executive's death; or

                  (d) a determination that the Executive is eligible for
long-term disability benefits under the Bank's long-term disability insurance
program or, if there is no such program, under the federal Social Security Act;

then subject to the provisions of the next immediately succeeding sentence,
which shall be applicable in the event of the Executive's death, the Bank shall
have no further obligations under this Agreement, other than the payment to the
Executive (or, in the event of his death, to his estate) of his earned but
unpaid salary as of the date of the termination of his employment, and the


                                   Page 10 of 17


<PAGE>



provision of such other benefits, if any, to which he is entitled as a former
employee under the employee benefit plans and programs and compensation plans
and programs maintained by, or covering employees of, the Bank. In the event of
the Executive's death, the payments and benefits described in sections 9(b)(ii),
9(b)(iii) and 9(b)(x)(A), (B) and (C) shall be provided to the Executive's
surviving spouse.

                  SECTION 11. TERMINATION UPON OR FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

                  (a) A Change in Control of the Bank ("Change in Control")
shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following
events:

                  (i) approval by the stockholders of the Bank of a transaction
         that would result in the reorganization, merger or consolidation of the
         Bank, respectively, with one or more other persons, other than a
         transaction following which:

                           (A) at least 51% of the equity ownership interests of
                  the entity resulting from such transaction are beneficially
                  owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
                  Exchange Act) in substantially the same relative proportions
                  by persons who, immediately prior to such transaction,
                  beneficially owned (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
                  promulgated under the Exchange Act) at least 51% of the
                  outstanding equity ownership interests in the Bank; and

                           (B) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote
                  generally in the election of directors of the entity resulting
                  from such transaction are beneficially owned (within the
                  meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) in
                  substantially the same relative proportions by persons who,
                  immediately prior to such transaction, beneficially owned
                  (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the
                  Exchange Act) at least 51% of the securities entitled to vote
                  generally in the election of directors of the Bank;

                  (ii) the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets
         of the Bank or beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
         promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 20% or more of the outstanding
         securities of the Bank entitled to vote generally in the election of
         directors by any person or by any persons acting in concert, or
         approval by the stockholders of the Bank of any transaction which would
         result in such an acquisition;

                  (iii) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Bank, or
         approval by the stockholders of the Bank of a plan for such liquidation
         or dissolution;

                  (iv) the occurrence of any event if, immediately following
         such event, at least 50% of the members of the board of directors of
         the Bank do not belong to any of the following groups:

                           (A) individuals who were members of the Board of the
                  Bank on the date of this Agreement; or

                           (B) individuals who first became members of the Board
                  of the Bank after the date of this Agreement either:

                                    (I) upon election to serve as a member of
                           the Board of directors of the Bank by affirmative
                           vote of three-quarters of the members of such board,
                           or of a nominating committee thereof, in office at
                           the time of such first election; or

                                    (II) upon election by the stockholders of
                           the Board to serve as a member of the board of
                           directors of the Board, but only if nominated for
                           election by affirmative vote of three-quarters of the
                           members of the board of directors of the Board, or of
                           a nominating committee thereof, in office at the time
                           of such first nomination;

                  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such individual's election or
                  nomination did not result from an actual or threatened
                  election contest (within the meaning of Rule 14a-11 of
                  Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other
                  actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents
                  (within the meaning of Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A
                  promulgated under the Exchange Act) other than by or on behalf
                  of the Board of the Bank; or

                  (v) any event which would be described in section 11(a)(i),
         (ii), (iii) or (iv) if the term "Company" were substituted for the term
         "Bank" therein.

In no event, however, shall a Change in Control be deemed to have occurred as a
result of any acquisition of securities or assets of the Company, the Bank, or a
subsidiary of either of them, by the Company, the Bank, or a subsidiary of
either of them, or by any employee benefit plan maintained by any of them. For
purposes of this section 11(a), the term "person" shall have the meaning
assigned to it under sections 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act.

                  (b) In the event of a Change in Control, the Executive shall
be entitled to the payments and benefits contemplated by section 9(b) in the
event of his termination of employment with the Bank under any of the
circumstances described in section 9(a) of this Agreement or under any of the
following circumstances:

                  (i) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period and within ninety (90) days
         following his demotion, loss of title, office or significant authority
         or responsibility, or following any material reduction in any element
         of his package of compensation and benefits;


                                   Page 12 of 17


<PAGE>



                  (ii) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period and within ninety (90) days
         following (A) any relocation of his principal place of employment
         outside of a 25-mile radius of the principal place of employment
         immediately prior to the Change of Control that would require a
         relocation of his residence in order to be able to commute to such new
         place of employment within a commuting time not in excess of the
         greater of 60 minutes or the Executive's commuting time prior to the
         Change of Control or (B) any material adverse change in working
         conditions at such principal place of employment; or

                  (iii) resignation, voluntary or otherwise, by the Executive at
         any time during the Employment Period following the failure of any
         successor to the Bank in the Change of Control to include the Executive
         in any compensation or benefit program maintained by it or covering any
         of its executive officers, unless the Executive is already covered by a
         substantially similar plan of the Bank which is at least as favorable
         to him.

                  SECTION 12.    NO EFFECT ON EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS OR
PROGRAMS.

                  The termination of the Executive's employment during the term
of this Agreement or thereafter, whether by the Bank or by the Executive, shall
have no effect on the rights and obligations of the parties hereto under the
Bank's qualified or non-qualified retirement, pension, savings, thrift,
profit-sharing or stock bonus plans, group life, health (including
hospitalization, medical and major medical), dental, accident and long term
disability insurance plans or such other employee benefit plans or programs, or
compensation plans or programs, as may be maintained by, or cover employees of,
the Bank from time to time.

                  SECTION 13.       SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the Executive, his legal representatives and testate or intestate
distributees, and the Bank and its successors and assigns, including any
successor by merger or consolidation or a statutory receiver or any other per-
son or firm or corporation to which all or substantially all of the assets and
business of the Bank may be sold or otherwise transferred. Failure of the Bank
to obtain from any successor its express written assumption of the Bank's
obligations hereunder at least sixty (60) days in advance of the scheduled
effective date of any such succession shall be deemed a material breach of this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 14.       NOTICES.

                  Any communication required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement, including any notice, direction, designation, consent, instruction,
objection or waiver, shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given
at such time as it is delivered personally, or five (5) days after mailing if
mailed, postage prepaid, by registered or certified mail, return receipt

connection with or arising out of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may

covenant, or condition. A waiver of any provision of this Agreement must be made
in writing, designated as a waiver, and signed by the party against whom its
enforcement is sought. Any waiver or relinquishment of any right or power
hereunder at any one or more times shall not be deemed a waiver or
relinquishment of such right or power at any other time or times.

                  SECTION 18.       COUNTERPARTS.

                  This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more

If and to the extent that any of the foregoing provisions shall cease to be

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered into this
___ day of November 1998 by and between Mehdi Ghomeshi (hereinafter the
"Executive") and BankUnited Financial Corporation, a Florida corporation
("BankUnited"), and its principal wholly owned subsidiary, BankUnited, FSB
(BankUnited and BankUnited, FSB are collectively referred to herein as the
"Company" and are jointly and severally obligated hereunder subject to the
provisions of Section 17.4 hereof).

                                    RECITALS

         A. The Executive possesses intimate knowledge of, and experience in,
the banking industry.

         B. The Boards of Directors of BankUnited and BankUnited, FSB
(collectively referred to herein as the "Board") have determined that it is in
the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to assure that the
Company will have the services of the Executive as its President and Chief
Operating Officer, and to compensate him therefor.

         C. The Company, on behalf of itself and its shareholders, also wishes
to retain well-qualified key personnel (such as Executive), and to assure itself
of the continuity of its management.

         D. The Company is concerned that in the event of a possible or
threatened Change in Control (as hereinafter defined), uncertainties necessarily
arise and the Executive may have concerns about his employment status and
responsibilities, and may be approached by others offering competing employment
opportunities, and the Company therefore desires to provide the Executive
assurances as to the continuation of his employment status and responsibilities
in such event. The Company further desires to assure that, if a possible or
threatened Change in Control should arise and the Executive should be involved
in deliberations or negotiations in connection therewith, the Executive would be
in a secure position to consider and participate in such transaction as
objectively as possible in the best interests of the Company and, to this end,
desires to protect the Executive from any direct or implied threat to his
financial well-being.

         E. The Board has determined that this Agreement will reinforce and
encourage the Executive's attention and dedication to the Company.

         F. The Executive is willing to make his services available to the
Company on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, but desires assurance
that in the event of such a threatened or actual Change in Control he will
continue to have the employment status and responsibilities he could reasonably
expect absent such event and, in the event of his termination or a Change in
Control, he will have fair and reasonable severance protection on the basis of
his service to the Company at that time.

         2.       EMPLOYMENT.

                  2.1 EMPLOYMENT AND TERM. The Company hereby agrees to employ
the Executive and the Executive hereby agrees to serve the Company, on the terms
and conditions set forth herein, for the thirty (30) month period commencing on
December 1, 1998 (hereinafter the "Commencement Date") and expiring at the
conclusion of May 31, 2001 (the "Term") unless sooner terminated as hereinafter
set forth; provided, however, that commencing on June 1, 2001 and each year
thereafter (the "Extension Date"), subject to review under Section 2.4 hereof,
the Term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for an additional
period of twelve (12) months from that date unless at least six (6) months prior
to such Extension Date, the Company shall have delivered to the Executive, or
the Executive shall have delivered to the Company, written notice that the Term
of the Executive's employment hereunder will not be extended. In the event any
such notice is delivered by the Company to the Executive or by the Executive to
the Company, thereafter, so long as the Executive is performing his obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, the Executive may begin his search and may interview
for subsequent employment, which actions shall not constitute a breach of this
Agreement by the Executive or give rise to a basis for his termination for Cause
(as such term is defined in Section 5.1 hereof).

                  2.2 POSITION AND DUTIES OF EXECUTIVE. The Executive shall
serve as the President and Chief Operating Officer of BankUnited and BankUnited,
FSB, and shall have powers and authority superior to any other officer or
employee of the Company or of any subsidiary of the Company (excepting the
Chairman of the Board). The Executive shall be responsible for all lines of
business and all support functions, and shall manage the affairs of the Company
on a day-to-day basis. Subject to the preceding sentences, during the Term of
employment, the Executive shall diligently perform all services as may be
reasonably assigned to him by the Board (or its Chairman) and shall exercise
such power and authority as may from time to time be delegated to him by the
Board (or its Chairman). Executive shall be required to report solely to, and
shall be subject solely to the supervision and direction of, the Board (or its
Chairman) at duly called meetings thereof, and no other person or group shall be
given authority to supervise or direct Executive in the performance of his
duties. The Executive shall devote substantially all his working time and
attention to the business and affairs of the Company, render such services
efficiently and to the best of his ability, and use his best efforts to promote
the interests of the Company.

                  2.3 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. In connection with his employment by
the Company, the Executive shall be based at the Company's principal executive
offices (which shall be in Miami-Dade County, Broward County or Palm Beach
County, Florida) unless a change of location is mutually satisfactory to the
Executive and the Company, except for required travel on the Company's business.
To the extent the Executive, as a consequence of his employment, is required to
relocate from Miami-Dade County, Florida, the Company shall reimburse the
Executive for all reasonable costs incurred in connection with the relocation
including, but not limited to, moving expenses and transaction costs related to
the sale of his home, such expenses to include brokerage commissions

                                        3


<PAGE>



and transfer costs customarily paid by sellers of residential real property.

                  2.4 PERFORMANCE REVIEW. It is the intent of the parties that
the Executive's performance be reviewed with the Board of Directors once each
year (as said term is defined in Section 3.2 hereof).

         3.       COMPENSATION.

                  3.1 BASE SALARY. The Executive shall receive a base salary of
$325,000 (the "Base Salary") per year during the Term of this Agreement, with
such Base Salary payable in installments consistent with the Company's standard
payroll practice for executives. On each anniversary of the Commencement Date
commencing in 1999, the Compensation Committee of the Board (or the full Board
in the absence of such committee or a replacement therefor) may engage in good
faith negotiations with the Executive concerning an increase of the Executive's
then Base Salary . The Base Salary shall not be decreased for any reason. Any
increase in Base Salary shall not limit or reduce any obligation to the
Executive under this Agreement.

                  3.2 ANNUAL BONUS. The Executive shall be entitled to a cash
bonus (the "Annual Bonus") for each year of the Term (for purposes of this
Agreement a "year" shall mean, with respect to the first year, the period
starting on the Commencement Date of this Agreement and ending on the first
anniversary thereafter, and for each subsequent year, a period commencing on the
day after the end of the preceding year and ending twelve (12) months
thereafter). The Annual Bonus for a year shall be based upon merit during such
year (taking into account various factors including net income, assets and
deposit growth, and such other factors as may be deemed appropriate) and shall
be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board (or the full Board in
the absence of such Committee or a replacement therefor); provided, however,
that the minimum amount of the Bonus shall be $50,000 for the year to which the
Bonus relates. The Annual Bonus for a year shall be paid, at the election of the
Executive, in the immediately following months of December or January.

         4.       ADDITIONAL BENEFITS.

                  4.1 EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT. During the Term, the Company, upon
the submission of supporting documentation by the Executive in form sufficient
to permit deduction thereof under applicable tax law, shall promptly reimburse
the Executive for all reasonable expenses actually paid or incurred by the
Executive in the course of and pursuant to the business of the Company,
including expenses for entertainment and all travel and living expenses while
away from home on business or at the request of the Company, provided that such
expenses are incurred and accounted for in accordance with the Company's regular
policies and procedures.

                  4.2 OTHER BENEFITS. The Company shall obtain or shall continue
in force comprehensive major medical and hospitalization insurance coverages,
including dental coverage, either group or individual, for the Executive and his
dependents, and shall obtain or shall continue in force disability and life
insurance for the Executive (collectively, the "Policies"), which Policies the
Company shall keep in effect at its sole expense throughout the Term. To the
extent any Policies

                                        4


<PAGE>



have an eligibility period, Executive may maintain his existing equivalent
coverage under COBRA and the Company shall reimburse him for that expense until
the eligibility period is satisfied. The Policies to be provided by the Company
shall be on terms as determined by the Board; provided, however, that the death
benefit under the life insurance policy(ies) maintained on behalf of the
Executive shall be at least equal to a face amount of $2,000,000 and shall be
payable to beneficiary(s) designated by the Executive. In addition to the group
disability insurance coverage provided by the Company to its executive
employees, the Company shall pay to the Executive $6,000 annually to reimburse
him for the cost of an individual disability policy which would provide the
Executive monthly disability benefits of $11,125 (or such disability benefits as
the Executive individually secures with the reimbursed amount), without
deduction for any payments provided under the Company's group disability
insurance coverage. Regardless of anything herein to the contrary, if at any
time during the Executive's employment hereunder, the Company agrees to provide
or provides any benefit to any other executive officer of the Company (excepting
the Chairman of the Board), which benefit is not otherwise provided to the
Executive hereunder, or which is greater than a similar benefit provided to the
Executive hereunder, the Company shall provide such benefit to the Executive or
increase his benefit to be at least equal to such benefit agreed to be provided
or provided to such other executive officer . Nothing paid to the Executive
under any plan or arrangement presently in effect or made available in the
future shall be deemed to be in lieu of the Base Salary or Annual Bonus payable
to the Executive pursuant to this Agreement.

                  4.3 WORKING FACILITIES AND SUPPORT STAFF. The Company shall
furnish the Executive with an office or offices, of a size and with furnishings
and other appointments, and secretarial and such other facilities and support
services suitable to his position and adequate for the performance of his duties
hereunder. The office facilities and support staff shall substantially equal the
most favorable provided to any other officer or employee of the Company.

                  4.4 AUTOMOBILE ALLOWANCE. During the Term, the Company shall
provide Executive with an automobile allowance of fifteen hundred dollars
($1,500) per month, which amount is intended to compensate Executive for wear
and tear and, in addition, reimburse the Executive for all costs of gasoline,
oil, repairs, maintenance, insurance and other expenses incurred by Executive by
reason of the use of Executive's automobile for Company business from time to
time. The amount of this allowance will be reviewed by the Company and the
Executive on each anniversary from the Commencement Date during the Term,
commencing in 1999, and increased prospectively as is necessary to compensate
and reimburse the Executive for such wear and tear and costs.

                  4.5 VACATION. The Executive shall be entitled to four (4)
weeks vacation per year, said vacation to be scheduled so as not to materially
interfere with the performance by the Executive of his duties pursuant to this
Agreement.

                  4.6 COUNTRY CLUB MEMBERSHIP. The Company shall pay initiation
fees (not to exceed $20,000) and dues for the Executive's membership at a
country club of his choice, and such luncheon clubs as he deems appropriate for
the discharge of his duties hereunder.

                                        5


<PAGE>



                  4.7 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. Executive shall be granted
annually options to purchase at least 30,000 shares of the Company's Class A
Common Stock, such grants to be based upon Executive's performance and the
market price of such stock. Any such future grants shall provide that the
options immediately vest upon a Change in Control as defined in Section 6, the
Executive's termination under Sections 5.2 or 5.3, or the Company or the
Executive advising the other pursuant to Section 2.1 that the Term of this
Agreement will not be extended. Executive shall also be eligible to participate
in stock option, incentive compensation and other plans providing opportunities
to receive additional compensation.

                  4.8 ESTATE PLANNING. The Company shall pay the cost for
reasonable estate planning services that the Executive receives from time to
time; provided, however, that the aggregate amount of the foregoing, shall not
exceed $5000 per year.

                  4.9 SECURITIES GRANTS. At the first meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Company following Commencement Date, Executive shall receive:

                  a) a grant of 35,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common
Stock, ownership of which is to vest on January 4, 1999;

                  b) a grant of options to purchase 70,000 shares of the
Company's Class A Common Stock at a price of $7 1/8 and with an expiration date
of ten (10) years, which options will vest 50% at the first anniversary from the
Commencement Date, 25% at the second anniversary from the Commencement Date, and
25% at the third anniversary from the Commencement Date, subject to immediate
vesting in the event of the Executive's termination under Sections 5.2 or 5.3,
the Company or the Executive advising the other pursuant to Section 2.1 that the
Term of this Agreement will not be extended, or in the event of a Change of
Control as defined in Section 6.

         5.       TERMINATION.

                  5.1 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated by the Company for
Cause. As used in this Agreement, "Cause" shall only mean (i) any action or
omission of the Executive which constitutes a willful and material breach of
this Agreement which is not cured within sixty (60) days after receipt by
Executive of specific written notice of same, (ii) the Executive intentionally
engages in dishonest conduct in connection with his performance of services for
the Company and that results in his conviction for a felony, (iii) the
conviction of Executive for, or a plea of guilty or NOLO CONTENDERE to, a
criminal act which is a felony; (iv) the Executive willfully and materially
breaches a fiduciary duty owed to the Company, for personal profit; or (v) the
Executive's willful and material breach or violation of any law, rule,
regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses), or final cease
and desist order in connection with his performance of services for the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive shall not be deemed to be
terminated for Cause unless and until:

                  (a) the Board first holds a meeting, as to which the Executive
was provided ten (10) days advance notice and an opportunity to be heard, and
the Board delivers written notice to the Executive specifying in detail the
action or inaction of the Executive alleged to constitute Cause and

                                        6


<PAGE>



demanding that he remedy such action or inaction;

                  (b) the Executive shall not have remedied such action or
inaction allegedly constituting Cause within twenty (20) days after his receipt
of such written notice; and

                  (c) there shall have been delivered to the Executive a Notice
of Termination and a certified copy of a resolution duly adopted by the
affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Board (excluding the Executive)
at a special meeting of the Board at which the Executive was given a further
opportunity to appear with legal counsel of his choosing to refute any
allegations of Cause, which meeting was called and held for the purpose of
finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the Executive's action or
inaction constituted Cause and the Executive did not remedy such action or
inaction after demand by the Board.

                  Nothing in Section 5.1(b) shall, prior to delivery of a Notice
of Termination as provided herein, be deemed to suspend or extinguish the
Executive's entitlement to receive the compensation and other benefits provided
under Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3 and 6. In the event that the Company terminates
the employment of the Executive for Cause and, within 30 days after receipt of
the Notice of Termination, the Executive notifies the Company that he disputes
such termination, the Executive shall still be subject to the obligations set
forth in Section 2 and entitled to receive the compensation and other benefits
provided under Sections 3, 4, 5.2, 5.3 and 6 until a final and binding judgment
is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction finding that the termination
was properly for Cause, in which event all payments subsequent to termination to
which the Executive would not otherwise be entitled shall be recoverable by the
Company, except to the extent such payments constitute reasonable compensation
for services rendered.

                  5.2 TERMINATION FOR DEATH OR DISABILITY. This Agreement shall
terminate automatically upon the Executive's death and may be terminated by the
Company upon the Executive's Disability. Upon a termination by reason of the
Executive's Disability, the Company shall pay to the Executive or his
beneficiaries, as the case may be, (i) any compensation or other obligations
accrued for periods prior to the Date of Termination, all of which shall be paid
within 15 days after the Date of Termination, (ii) six months of Base Salary
plus an amount equal to one-half of the last Annual Bonus paid to the Executive,
all of which shall be paid in installments consistent with the Company's payroll
practice for executives, and (iii) implement the provisions for the Executive's
Vested Benefits as of the Date of Termination. If Termination is due to the
death of the Executive, the Company shall, within 15 days after the Date of
Termination, pay to the Executive's estate or beneficiaries, as the case may be,
(i) any unpaid Base Salary, Annual Bonus and benefits accrued for periods prior
to the Date of Termination, and (ii) the rights to the Vested Benefits, other
than life insurance and disability insurance, shall be provided to his spouse.
In

addition, the life insurance proceeds from the policies described in this
Agreement shall be paid to his personal representative or such other persons as
the Executive may have designated in writing.

                  5.3 TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. At any time the Company shall
have the right to terminate Executive's employment hereunder by written notice
to Executive; provided, however, that the Company shall (i) pay to Executive any
unpaid Base Salary, Annual Bonus and benefits and

                                        7


<PAGE>



amounts due under the programs described in Sections 4 and 6, (ii) continue to
pay Executive's Base Salary, Annual Bonus and benefits, described in Sections 4
and 6, for the balance of the then effective Term, and (iii) implement the
provisions for the Executive's Vested Benefits as of the Date of Termination. In
such event, the Executive shall be awarded an Annual Bonus of $75,000 per year
for the year to which the Annual Bonus relates for the balance of the then
effective Term. At the election of the Executive, such Base Salary, Annual
Bonus, Vested Benefits and amounts due shall be paid in one lump sum within
thirty (30) days after notice of such election is given to the Company by the
Executive. The Company shall be deemed to have terminated the Executive's
employment pursuant to this Section 5.3 if such employment is terminated (i) by
the Company without Cause, or (ii) by the Executive voluntarily as a result of
the occurrence of any of the following events which is not consented to in
writing, by the Executive prior to its occurrence or which is not cured by the
Company within thirty (30) days after its receipt of prompt written notice of
the Executive's objection to the occurrence: (a) Executive is assigned to any
position, duties or responsibilities that are diminished when compared with the
position, duties or responsibilities of the Executive on the date of this
Agreement, (b) the Executive's Base Salary or benefits are reduced or the
Executive's Annual Bonus is less than the minimum specified in Section 3.2, (c)
the Executive is requested to engage in conduct that is reasonably likely to
result in a violation of law, (d) the withdrawal from the Executive of any
authority described in Section 2.2 or a change of the reporting relationship
described in that Section, (e) the Company requiring, without his consent, the
Executive to maintain his principal office or conduct his principal activities
anywhere other than at the Company's principal executive offices in Miami-Dade
County, Broward County or Palm Beach County, Florida, (f) the failure by the
Company to obtain the assumption and agreement to perform this Agreement by any
successor as contemplated in Section 17.1 hereof, or (g) repudiation by the
Company of any material obligation of the Company under this Agreement. The
Executive shall have no duty or obligation to mitigate the obligations of the
Company (through seeking other employment or otherwise) in the event of
termination of his employment pursuant to this Section 5.3, and the Company's
obligations hereunder shall not be offset, mitigated or otherwise reduced by
reason of the Executive's subsequent employment or otherwise.

         6.       CHANGE IN CONTROL.

                  6.1 CHANGE IN CONTROL. A "Change in Control" shall be deemed

<PAGE>



(as defined in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act), directly or
indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities
beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the
Company) representing 25% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's
then outstanding voting securities;

                  (b) during any period of up to two consecutive years,
subsequent to the date hereof, the individuals who, at the beginning of such
period, constitute the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a
majority thereof, provided that any person who becomes a director subsequent to
the beginning of such period and whose nomination for election is approved by at
least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors
at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was
previously so approved (other than a director (A) whose initial assumption of
office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest relating
to the election of the directors of the Company, as such terms are used in Rule
14a-11 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, or (B) who was designated by a
Person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a
transaction described in clause (a), (c) or (d) hereof) shall be deemed a
director as of the beginning of such period;

                  (c) the stockholders of the Company approve a merger or
consolidation of the Company with any other corporation other than (A) a merger
or consolidation that would result in the voting securities of the Company
outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by
remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the
surviving entity or any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of
any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan
of any Corporation, at least 51% of the combined voting power of the voting
securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof
outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation, or (B) a merger or
consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or
similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes the beneficial owner (as
defined in clause (a) above), directly or indirectly, of securities of the
Company (not including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any
securities acquired directly from the Company) representing 25% or more of the
combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding voting securities;

                  (d) the stockholders of the Company approve a plan of complete
liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the
Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale
or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's
assets to an entity, at least 75% of the combined voting power of the voting
securities of which are owned by persons in substantially the same proportions
as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale; or

                  (e) any "Person" (as such term is defined in Sections
407(q)(9)(A) and 408(a)(1)(G) of the National Housing Act of 1934, as amended
[the "NHA"]) or group of Persons, shall have acquired "control" (as such term is
defined in Sections 407(q)(9)(B) and 408(a)(2) of the NHA) of the Company.

                  6.2 PAYMENTS UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL. Upon the first date on
which a Change

                                        9


<PAGE>



in Control occurs:

                  (a) the Company shall, within thirty (30) days following the
Change in Control, pay the Executive a Termination Payment; and

                  (b) the Executive shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to resign and the Company shall pay the Executive any Base Salary,
Annual Bonus or other benefits accrued for dates prior to the date of
resignation and implement the provisions of the Executive's Vested Benefits;
provided, however, that the Executive must remain in the employ of the acquiring
entity for a period of time not to exceed six (6) months if the acquiring entity
so desires; and

                  (c) nothing in, or done pursuant to, Sections 6.2 (a) or (b)
shall be deemed to suspend or extinguish the Executive's rights under Section 5.

                  6.3 ARRANGEMENTS NOT EXCLUSIVE OR LIMITING. The specific
arrangements referred to herein are not intended to exclude or limit the
Executive's participation in other benefits available to executive personnel
generally, or to preclude or limit other compensation or benefits as may be
authorized by the Board of the Company at any time, or to limit or reduce any
compensation or benefit to which the Executive would be entitled but for this
Agreement.

         7. GROSS-UP OF TERMINATION PAYMENTS. The parties intend that (i) the
net amount retained by the Executive (the "Net Termination Payment") upon the
receipt of the Termination Payment, after reduction for and payment of all
applicable federal, state and local income and employment taxes (the
"Withholding Taxes") or the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or any successor statute, rule or regulation
of similar effect (the "Code"), including interest and penalties, and payable by
or on behalf of the Executive, shall be an amount equal to three times the sum
of the Executive's Base Salary for the year in which the Executive's employment
is terminated plus the last Annual Bonus paid to the Executive, and (ii) the net
amount of all other payments or benefits retained or to be retained by the
Executive from the Company or from one of the Company's benefit plans as a
direct or indirect result of or in connection with a Change in Control or a
Potential Change in Control or in connection with a Termination, from whatever
source other than a Termination Payment (the "Other Payments"), that are or
become subject to the Excise Tax, shall be equal to the gross amount of Other
Payments payable to the Executive without regard to the reduction or payment of
any such Excise Tax, and without regard to this Section. Accordingly, the
Termination Payment shall include an amount (the "Gross-Up Payment") sufficient
that, after payment of all Withholding Taxes and Excise Tax payable by or on
behalf of the Executive in respect of the Termination Payment, the Other
Payments and any other payments payable pursuant to the provisions of this
Section (including the cumulative effect of the Gross-Up Payment on Withholding
Taxes and Excise Tax), the Executive will actually retain an amount equal to the
Net Termination Payment and will actually receive the value of the Other
Payments, without diminution for Withholding Taxes or Excise Tax.

                  (a) In determining the Withholding Taxes payable by or on
behalf of the Executive, the Executive shall be deemed to pay federal, state and
local income taxes on the date of Termination, at the highest marginal rates
imposed on individuals under Section 1 of the Code, with

                                       10


<PAGE>



respect to federal income taxes, and at the highest marginal rates imposed under
the laws of the state and locale of the Executive's residence on the date of
Termination, with respect to state and local income taxes, as such laws are in
effect during the calendar year in which the date of Termination occurs. Such
federal income taxes shall be determined taking account of the maximum deduction
permitted for the payment of such state and local taxes. In addition, the
Executive shall be deemed to be subject to only the tax imposed by Section
3101(b) of the Code.

                  (b) In determining the Excise Tax payable by or on behalf of
the Executive, all Termination Payment and the Other Payments shall be deemed to
constitute "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code, except to the extent that, in the opinion of tax counsel selected
by the Company's independent auditors and acceptable to the Executive, such
payments (in whole or in part) do not constitute "parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code, or represent reasonable
compensation for services actually rendered or to be rendered within the meaning
of Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code.

                  (c) In determining the amount of the Other Payments, the value
of any non-cash benefits or any deferred payment or benefit shall be determined
by the Company's independent auditors in accordance with the principles of
Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the Code.

                  (d) In the event the amount or amounts of the Excise Tax or
Withholding Taxes are subsequently determined to be less than the amounts taken
into account hereunder at the time of the payment of the Gross-Up Payment, the
Executive shall repay the Company the portion of such payment attributable to
such reduction, taking into account the effect of any deductions allowable to
the Executive for such repayment, consistent with the provisions of Paragraph
(a) of this Section.

                  (e) The Executive shall notify the Company in writing of any
claim by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority
(collectively, the "IRS") that, if successful, would require the payment by the
Company of a Gross-Up Payment (other than a Gross-Up Payment previously paid).
Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than ten
(10) business days after the Executive is informed in writing of such claim, and
shall apprise the Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such
claim is requested to be paid. The Executive shall not pay such claim prior to
the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which it gives such
notice to the Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any
payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If the Company notifies the
Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to
contest such claim, the Executive shall:

                           (i) give the Company any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to such claim;

                           (ii) take such action in connection with contesting
such claim as the Company reasonably requests in writing from time to time,
including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to
such claim by an attorney reasonably selected by the Company,

                           (iii) cooperate with the Company in good faith in
order effectively to contest such claim, and

                                       11


<PAGE>



                           (iv) permit the Company to participate in any
proceedings relating to such claim; provided, however, that the Company shall
bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and
penalties) incurred in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold
the Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Withholding Taxes or
Excise Tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a
result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without
limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph (e), the Company shall
control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and may, at its
sole option, pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and
may, at its sole option, either direct the Executive to pay the tax claimed and
sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and the
Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any
administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more
appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the
Company directs the Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, the
Company shall advance the amount of such payment to the Executive, on an
interest-free basis, and shall indemnify and hold the Executive harmless, on an
after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or
penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with
respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and further provided
that the Executive shall not be required to extend the statute of limitations
relating to payment of taxes for the taxable year of the Executive with respect
to which such contested amount is claimed to be due except with respect to such
contested amount. Furthermore, the Company's control of the contest shall be
limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable
hereunder and the Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case
may be, any other issue raised by the IRS.

                  (f) If, after the receipt by the Executive of an amount
advanced by the Company pursuant to Paragraph (e)(iv), the Executive becomes
entitled to receive any refund or credit with respect to such contested claim,
the Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of
Paragraph (e)(iv)) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund or
credit (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes
applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by the Executive of any such advance,
a determination is made that the Executive shall not be entitled to any refund
with respect to such contested claim, and the Company does not notify the
Executive in writing of its intent to contest such determination within thirty
(30) days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and
shall not be required to be repaid and shall be an offset against the amount of
Gross-Up Payment required to be paid.

         8.       CERTAIN REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS.

                  8.1 If the Executive is suspended and/or temporarily
prohibited from participating in the conduct of BankUnited, FSB's affairs by a
notice served under Sections 8(e)(3) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act (12 U.S.C. /sections/ 1818 (e)(3) or (g)(1)), (the "Act"), the Company's
obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended as of the date of service,
unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in such notice are
dismissed, the Company shall pay to the Executive all of the compensation
withheld while the obligations under this Agreement were suspended and shall
reinstate its obligations hereunder.

                                       12


<PAGE>



                  8.2 If the Executive is removed and/or permanently prohibited
from participating in the conduct of BankUnited, FSB's affairs by an order
issued under Sections 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. /sections/ 1818
(e)(4) or (g)(1)), all obligations of the Company shall terminate as of the
effective date of the order, but vested rights of the parties hereto shall not
be affected.

                  8.3 If BankUnited, FSB is in default (as defined in Section
3(x)(1) of the Act), all obligations under this Agreement shall terminate as of
the date of default, but this subsection shall not affect any vested rights of
the parties hereto.

                  8.4 All obligations under this Agreement shall be terminated,
except to the extent determined that continuation of this Agreement is necessary
for the continued operation of BankUnited, FSB (i) by the Director of the Office
of Thrift Supervision or his/her designee (the "Director"), at the time the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") enters into an agreement to
provide assistance to or on behalf of BankUnited, FSB under the authority
contained in Section 13c of the Act; or (ii) by the Director, at the time the
Director approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation
of BankUnited, FSB or when BankUnited, FSB is determined by the Director to be
in an unsafe or unsound condition. Any rights of the parties hereto that have
already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action.

                  8.5 Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary,
any payments to the Executive by BankUnited Financial Corporation, whether
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, are subject to and conditioned upon
their compliance with Section 18(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12
U.S.C. /section/1828(k), and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

         9. REPRESENTATION BY THE EXECUTIVE. The Executive will be required to
represent and warrant, as of the Commencement Date, that he is not a party to
any agreement, contract or understanding, whether of employment or otherwise, or
subject to any governmental restriction, which would in any way restrict or
prohibit him from undertaking or performing employment with the Company in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Executive has
disclosed that he has a contract of employment with his present employer and
that he has tendered his resignation to be effective December 1, 1998.

         10. WITHHOLDING. The Company may withhold from any amounts payable
under this Agreement such federal, state or local taxes as shall be required to
be withheld pursuant to any applicable law or regulations.

         11. ATTORNEYS' FEES. The Company agrees to pay such reasonable
attorneys' fees (not to exceed $10,000) as are incurred by the Executive with
respect to advice and counsel concerning or related to the negotiation and
preparation of this Agreement. The Company shall pay reasonable costs and
attorneys' fees incurred by the Executive in connection with any Board action
pursuant to Section 5.1 in the event that the Board does not determine that
"Cause" exists in accordance with the procedures in said Section. The Company
shall also indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Executive against reasonable
costs, including legal fees, incurred by him in connection with or arising out
of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved, as a result of
his efforts, in good faith, to defend or enforce the terms of this Agreement;
provided, however, that the

                                       13


<PAGE>



Executive shall have substantially prevailed on the merits pursuant to a
judgment, decree or order of a court of competent jurisdiction or of an
arbitrator in an arbitration proceeding, or in a settlement. For purposes of
this Agreement, any settlement agreement which provides for payment of any
amounts in settlement of the Company's obligations hereunder shall be conclusive
evidence of the Executive's entitlement to indemnification hereunder, and any
such indemnification payments shall be in addition to amounts payable pursuant
to such settlement agreement, unless such settlement agreement expressly
provides otherwise.

         12. ENFORCEMENT COSTS. The Company is aware that upon the occurrence of
a Change in Control, the Board of Directors or a stockholder of the Company may
then cause or attempt to cause the Company to refuse to comply with its
obligations under Section 6 of this Agreement, or may cause or attempt to cause
the Company to institute, or may institute, litigation seeking to have Section 6
of this Agreement declared unenforceable, or may take, or attempt to take, other
action to deny the Executive the benefits intended under Section 6 of this
Agreement. In these circumstances, the purpose of this Agreement could be
frustrated. It is the intent of the parties that the Executive not be required
to incur the legal fees and expenses associated with the protection or
enforcement of his rights under Section 6 of this Agreement by litigation or
other legal action because such costs would substantially detract from the
benefits intended to be extended to the Executive hereunder, nor be bound to
negotiate any settlement of his rights hereunder under threat of incurring such
costs. Accordingly, if at any time after the Commencement Date, it should appear
to the Executive that the Company is or has acted contrary to or is failing or
has failed to comply with any of its obligations under Section 6 of this
Agreement for the reason that it regards this Agreement to be void or
unenforceable or for any other reason, or in the event that the Company or any
other person takes any action to declare Section 6 of this Agreement void or
unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other legal action designed to
deny, diminish or to recover from the Executive the benefits provided or
intended to be provided to him under Section 6, and the Executive has acted in
good faith to perform his obligations under this Agreement, the Company
irrevocably authorizes the Executive from time to time to retain counsel of his
choice at the expense of the Company to represent him in connection with the
protection and enforcement of his rights under Section 6, including without
limitation representation in connection with termination of his employment
contrary to Section 6 of this Agreement or with the initiation or defense of any
litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Executive or the
Company or any director, officer, stockholder or other person affiliated with
the Company, in any jurisdiction. The reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
selected from time to time by the Executive as herein above provided shall be
paid or reimbursed to the Executive by the Company on a regular, periodic basis
upon presentation by the Executive of a statement or statements prepared by such
counsel in accordance with its customary practices. Counsel so retained by the
Executive may be counsel representing other officers or key executives of the
Company in connection with the protection and enforcement of their rights under
similar agreements between them and the Company, and, unless in his sole
judgment use of common counsel could be prejudicial to him or would not be
likely to reduce the fees and expenses chargeable hereunder to the Company, the
Executive agrees to use his best efforts to agree with such other officers or
executives to retain common counsel.

         13. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

                                       14


<PAGE>



         14. NON-ALIENATION. The Executive shall not have any right to pledge,
hypothecate, anticipate, or in any way create a lien upon any amounts provided
under this Agreement, and no payments or benefits due hereunder shall be
assignable in anticipation of payment either by voluntary or involuntary acts or
by operation of law. So long as the Executive lives, no person, other than the
parties hereto, shall have any rights under or interest in this Agreement or in
the subject matter hereof.

         15. NOTICES. Any notice required or permitted to be given under this
Agreement shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been given when
delivered by hand or when deposited in the United States mail, by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed as follows:

                  If to the Company:

                  Alfred R. Camner, Chairman
                  BankUnited Financial Corporation

or to such other addresses as either party hereto may from time to time give
notice of to the other in the aforesaid manner.

         16. SEVERABILITY. The invalidity of any one or more of the words,
phrases, sentences, clauses or sections contained in this Agreement shall not
affect the enforceability of the remaining portions of this Agreement or any
part thereof, all of which are inserted conditionally on their being valid in
law, and, in the event that any one or more of the words, phrases, sentences,
clauses or sections contained in this Agreement shall be declared invalid, this
Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid word or words, phrase or
phrases, sentence or sentences, clause or clauses, or section or sections had
not been inserted.

         17.      SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

                  17.1 The Company shall require any successor, whether direct
or indirect to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
whether by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, prior to or
contemporaneously with such acquisition, by agreement in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Executive and his legal counsel, to assume and
agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that
the Company would be required to perform it if no such acquisition had taken
place (to the extent not previously performed by the Company). As used in this
Agreement, "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore

                                       15


<PAGE>



defined and any such successor which executes and delivers the agreement
provided for in this Section 17.1 or which otherwise becomes bound by all the
terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law.

                  17.2 This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.

                  17.3 This Agreement is personal to the Executive and, without
the prior written consent of the Company, shall not be assignable by the
Executive otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.

                  17.4 BankUnited and BankUnited, FSB shall be jointly and
severally obligated under this Agreement to the extent permitted by applicable
law. BankUnited, FSB shall not be deemed to be a guarantor of payments required
under Section 7 hereof.

         18. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, MODIFICATIONS AND WAIVER. This Agreement
constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and the Executive with
respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements,
understandings and arrangements, both oral and written, between the Company and
the Executive with respect to such subject matter including, but not limited to,
any employee manuals of the Company. No modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by all parties
hereto. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall
constitute a waiver of any other provision (whether or not similar), nor shall
any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver. The failure of the Executive or
the Company to insist upon strict compliance with any provision hereof shall not
be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or any other provision thereof.

                                       16


<PAGE>


         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Executive and, pursuant to the authorization
