Item 1. Business

BUSINESS OF BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION

General

     BankUnited is a Florida corporation and the savings and loan holding
company for BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"). BankUnited's principal business
currently consists of the operations of the Bank. The Bank was founded in 1984
as a savings and loan association. In 1993, the Bank was converted to a
federally chartered savings bank and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
BankUnited, pursuant to a plan of reorganization approved by its shareholders.
The Bank's revenues are derived principally from interest earned on loans,
mortgage-backed securities and investments, and its primary expenses arise from
interest paid on deposits and borrowings and non-interest operating expenses
incurred in operations. At September 30, 2000, BankUnited had assets of $4.6
billion, deposits of $2.6 billion and stockholders' equity of $ 0.2 billion.

     Prior to 1998, the primary business strategy of BankUnited was to generate
stable interest-bearing deposits and use the proceeds to purchase residential
mortgages in the secondary market. In 1998, BankUnited initiated several
fundamental changes in its business strategy. During the first half of 1998,
through the Consumers Bancorp, Inc. ("Consumers") and Central Bank ("Central")
acquisitions, the Bank expanded its deposit base and product lines to include
new consumer and commercial products. In December 1998, after consideration of
several factors, the decision was made to reposition BankUnited. First, because
of continued competition from other investors and unfavorable changes in the
rate environment, the yields from purchased residential mortgages no longer
provided sufficient returns to BankUnited or to other institutions

                                       2
<PAGE>

with similar investment strategies. Second, increased competition for
certificates of deposit and other long-term savings from online brokers, mutual
funds and other out of market institutions resulted in an increase in interest
rates relative to earnings on assets. Third, numerous acquisitions of local
banks by sizeable out-of-state institutions created a large number of
dissatisfied customers who were seeking a strong, community-based bank and who
were willing to move their relationships. Fourth, the increasing velocity of
change and commoditization of the financial services industry made it
increasingly critical that surviving participants define customer bases and core
competencies and begin to deliver around them.

     BankUnited commenced this repositioning process by hiring a new President
and executive management team, under whose direction a restructuring to
streamline the organization, lower expenses, increase profit margins and improve
the use of its deposit base was completed. As a result of this restructuring,
BankUnited has eliminated its dependence on purchasing residential mortgage
loans in the secondary market; instead the focus is on originating residential
loans, and on increasing its emphasis on commercial lending, consumer lending
and small business banking. New products and services were implemented to meet
customer needs, and the expansion of the branch network continued.

     BankUnited currently has thirty-two branch offices in southeast Florida and
one in southwest Florida and anticipates opening four to six additional branch
offices in fiscal year 2001. BankUnited is also re-evaluating existing branch
locations to ensure that its markets are optimally served.

     The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (the "FHLB")
and is subject to comprehensive regulation, examination and supervision by the
Office of Thrift Supervision (the "OTS") and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC"). Deposits in the Bank are insured by the Savings
Association Insurance Fund to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Market Area and Competition

     BankUnited conducts business in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Collier
counties ("South Florida") which geographic region, at June 30, 2000, had a
total of approximately $86 billion in deposits at commercial banks and savings
institutions (42.4% of the total $202.7 billion of deposits in Florida).
BankUnited intends to continue to strategically establish or acquire branch
offices in its market area and may expand into other parts of Florida.

     BankUnited encounters strong competition in attracting retail and business
deposits and loans. BankUnited's most direct competition for deposits
historically has been from commercial banks, brokerage houses, other savings
associations, and credit unions located in its market area. Recently, BankUnited
has also experienced competition from out-of-state organizations that offer
premium deposit rates to offset their lack of physical locations in the market
area. Many non-bank competitors actively seek a share of deposit business and
some brokerage houses compete directly for small business loans. BankUnited also
competes in its market area with the branch offices of several regional and
super-regional commercial banks and savings associations that are substantially
larger and have more extensive operations than BankUnited, including

                                       3
<PAGE>

several formerly independent entities, which have recently been acquired by
larger institutions headquartered out of state.

     The consolidation of the financial services industry has created
opportunities and challenges for BankUnited. Mergers among institutions have
disrupted many customer relationships and created an opening for BankUnited to
acquire new customers. Larger institutions, however, have been able to achieve
economies of scale in operational processes, offer a broader and more
sophisticated product mix, have a reduced cost of capital and offer more
extensive electronic banking facilities. BankUnited's goal is to compete for
savings and other deposits by offering depositors a higher level of personal
service, together with a wide range of deposit products offered at competitive
rates.

     The competition in originating real estate and other loans comes
principally from commercial banks, mortgage banking companies and other savings
associations. BankUnited competes for loan originations primarily through the
interest rates and loan fees that it charges, the types of loans that it offers,
and the efficiency and quality of service that it provides. While BankUnited has
been, and intends to continue to be, primarily a residential lender, BankUnited
has recently increased its emphasis on commercial real estate, construction,
commercial and consumer lending, as discussed more fully below. Factors that
effect competition in lending include general and local economic conditions,
current interest rates and volatility of the mortgage markets. Management
continues to evaluate market needs and products to meet those needs that also
allow BankUnited to control the growth of its assets and liabilities. As with
its deposit products, BankUnited's strategy is to promote a higher level of
personal service and to position itself as a community bank offering a full
range of financial services.

Lending Activities

     From inception in 1984 through 1998, BankUnited's primary source of earning
assets was the purchase of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in the
secondary market. During the last six months of fiscal 1998 and the first six
months of fiscal 1999,BankUnited experienced significant prepayment of these
loans and as a result BankUnited discontinued purchasing One-Year CMT loans
which are adjustable-rate mortgages with an index tied to the weekly average
yield on one-year U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity
published by the Federal Reserve ("One-Year CMT"),altered its practice of
purchasing loans in the secondary market, and turned its focus to producing
assets. BankUnited's current lending strategy includes originating residential
mortgages and expanding its commercial real estate, real estate construction,
commercial, and small business lending, as well as offering consumer loans, such
as home equity loans and lines, and automobile loans. The credit approval
process generally involves both a credit scoring process and traditional
underwriting methodologies. BankUnited's credit approval policies and procedures
are updated as necessary to encompass new products and services.

     Loan Portfolio. BankUnited's loan portfolio primarily consists of mortgage
loans secured by one-to-four family residential and commercial real estate. As
of September 30, 2000, BankUnited's loan portfolio before deferred fees and
allowance for loan loss ("net items") totaled $3.7 billion, of which $3.2
billion or 87.8% consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. At
the

                                       4
<PAGE>

present time, BankUnited's residential real estate loans are primarily
"conventional" loans not insured by the Federal Housing Administration (the
"FHA") or guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (the "VA"). BankUnited is,
however, approved to originate FHA and VA loans. As of September 30, 2000, the
remainder of BankUnited's loan portfolio consisted of $155.6 million of
commercial real estate loans (4.2% of total loans); $83.0 million of commercial
business loans (2.3% of total loans); $73.3 million of construction and land
loans (2.0% of total loans); $66.5 million of consumer loans (1.8% of total
loans); and $71.0 million of multi-family (five-or-more units) residential real
estate loans (1.9 % of total loans).

     At September 30, 2000, $1.7 billion, or 47.2% of BankUnited's total loan
portfolio before net items, consisted of purchased mortgage loans and loan
participations, serviced by others. These loans were primarily one-to-four
family residential mortgage loans. At September 30, 2000, BankUnited's loan
portfolio included $445.6 million of residential mortgage loans to non-resident
aliens, which was 12.1% of total loans before net items. See "Residential
Mortgage Loan Originations and Purchases" for additional information on
BankUnited's loans to non-resident aliens.

Applicable regulations permit BankUnited to engage in various categories of
secured and unsecured commercial and consumer lending, in addition to
residential real estate financing, subject to limitations on the percentage of
total assets attributable to certain categories of loans. An additional
limitation imposed by regulation requires that certain types of loans only be
made in aggregate amounts that do not exceed specified percentages of the
institution's capital. The following table sets forth, as of September 30, 2000,
the amount of loans (including mortgage loans held for sale) by category and
expected principal repayments. These repayments are based on historical
experience.

items (36.8% of total assets) were secured by properties located in Florida and
11% of loans receivable before net items (8.8% of total assets) were secured by
properties located in California. No other state comprises more than 10%.
Because of this concentration, regional economic circumstances in those states
could affect the level of BankUnited's non-performing loans. The following table

One-to-Four Family Residential Mortgage Loan Originations and Purchases.
BankUnited's lending primarily involves originating loans secured by first
mortgages on real estate improved with single-family dwellings. During fiscal
2000, BankUnited continued to reduce its dependence on purchasing residential
mortgage loans in the secondary market by focusing on originating these loans.
BankUnited originates one-to-four family residential mortgage loans through its
branches and its network of non-affiliated wholesale brokers. In fiscal 2000,
the wholesale brokers generated approximately 92% of BankUnited's one-to-four
family residential mortgage loan originations. Currently, BankUnited is
generating these loans with approximately 200 wholesale brokers located mainly
in South Florida. During fiscal year 2001, BankUnited plans to expand its
wholesale broker network throughout the State of Florida and other selected
states. Originations in the wholesale program, together with branch lending,
reached $667.5 million, $592.9 million, and $312.7 million for the years ended
September 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

     The Bank services loans that it originates and endeavors to purchase loans
servicing-released when available and appropriate. At September 30, 2000, $3.2
billion or 87.7%, of BankUnited's total loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four
family residential loans, of which $1.5 billion, or 46.9%, were adjustable rate
mortgage ("ARM") loans and $1.7 billion, or 53.1%, were fixed rate mortgage
loans. BankUnited's first mortgage loans purchased or originated are generally
repayable over 15 or 30 years. Additionally, BankUnited offers 40 year ARM loans
on a limited basis. Residential loans typically remain outstanding for shorter
periods than their contractual maturities because borrowers prepay the loans in
full upon sale of the mortgaged property or upon refinancing of the original
loan.

     BankUnited's ARMs generally have interest rates that adjust after an
initial 1 month, 3 month, or 3, 5 or 7 year fixed-rate term ("hybrid" ARMs) and,
to a lesser extent, semi-annually or annually with subsequent interest rate
adjustments at a margin over the One-Year CMT or the 12 month moving average of
the monthly average yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant
maturity of one year published by the Federal Reserve ("MTA's"). Further, a
portion of these ARMs provide for initial rates of interest which are
significantly below the rates which would prevail were the contractual interest
rate index and margin used for repricing applied initially. Such loans are
commonly referred to as being in their teaser rate period. These loans adjust to
the contractual rate on the first scheduled interest rate adjustment date. The
maximum interest rate adjustment of BankUnited's ARMs is generally 1%
semi-annually and 6% over the life of the loan, above or below the initial rate
on the loan for semi-annual adjustable, or 2% annually and 6% over the life of
the loan, above or below the initial rate on the loan for annual adjustable and
hybrid ARMs. The maximum interest rate adjustment for Hybrid ARMs which are tied
to the MTA index range from none to 2%, periodically, and up to 11.95% over the
life of the loan.

     Applicable regulations permit BankUnited to lend up to 100% of the
appraised value of the real property securing a loan ("loan-to-value ratio").
When terms are favorable, BankUnited may purchase or originate single-family
mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios between 80% and 95%. In most of these
cases, BankUnited will, as a matter of policy, require the borrower to obtain
private mortgage insurance which insures that portion of the loan exceeding the
80% loan-to-value ratio, thereby reducing the risk to no more than 80% of
appraised value. All loans are reviewed by BankUnited's underwriters to ensure
that guidelines are met or that waivers are obtained in situations where
offsetting factors exist.

     For loan originations, upon receipt of a completed loan application from an
applicant, BankUnited generally orders a credit report, confirms income,
employment and other significant information of the applicant and obtains an
appraisal of the property securing the loan. BankUnited obtains the appraisal of
the property from an independent third party to determine the adequacy of the
collateral, and such appraisal is confirmed by one of the underwriters.

<PAGE>

     In its loan purchases, BankUnited generally reserves the right to reject
particular loans from a loan package being purchased and rejects loans in a
package that do not meet its commitment criteria. In determining whether to
purchase a loan, BankUnited assesses both the borrower's ability to repay the
loan and the adequacy of the proposed collateral. In determining the borrower's
ability to repay, BankUnited reviews information concerning the income,
financial condition, employment and credit history of the applicant and
generally obtains a credit report on the borrower separate from that provided by
the loan seller. BankUnited reviews the appraisal obtained by the loan seller or
originator and, based upon pre-determined criteria and review of the loan file,
may arrange for an updated review appraisal before purchasing the loan. An
appraisal will generally be ordered if the property securing the loan is located
in a designated area (such as a geographic region known for fluctuating property
values), if the loan size or loan-to-value ratio meets certain thresholds, or
if an underwriter or other Bank officer, upon review of the loan file,
determines that it is prudent to order an appraisal. With respect to a
substantial percentage of loans purchased, the collateral value is confirmed by
reference to a review appraisal. Otherwise, the collateral value is determined
by reference to the documentation contained in the original file. A legal review
of every loan file is conducted to determine the adequacy of the legal
documentation. BankUnited receives various representations and warranties from
the sellers of the loans regarding the quality and characteristics of the loans.

     BankUnited has adopted written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards
for use in the underwriting and review of every loan considered for origination
or purchase. These underwriting standards are reviewed and approved annually by
BankUnited's Board of Directors. BankUnited's underwriting standards for
residential mortgage loans generally conform to standards established by the
Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation (the "FHLMC"), except that BankUnited's underwriting
standards allow it to make loans (i) to non-resident aliens, as discussed below,
(ii) exceeding the FNMA or FHLMC limits, and (iii) in cases where specific
characteristics of the loan or borrower may compensate for the lack of
conformity with the FNMA or FHLMC criteria.

      Borrowers are required to obtain casualty insurance and, if applicable,
flood insurance in amounts at least equal to the outstanding loan balance or the
maximum amount allowed by law. BankUnited also requires that a survey be
conducted and title insurance be obtained, insuring the priority of its mortgage
lien.

     BankUnited originates first mortgage loans to non-resident aliens in a
manner similar to that described above for other residential loans. At September
30, 2000, approximately $445.6 million, or 12%, of the BankUnited's loan
portfolio before net items were first mortgage loans to non-resident aliens
secured by single-family residences located in Florida. Loans to non-resident
aliens generally afford BankUnited an opportunity to receive rates of interest
higher than those available from other single-family residential loans.
Nevertheless, certain aspects of such loans may involve a greater degree of risk
than conforming single-family residential mortgage loans. The ability to obtain
access to the borrower is more limited for non-resident aliens, as is the
ability to attach or verify assets located in foreign countries. BankUnited has
attempted to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards for such
loans including generally more conservative loan-to-value ratios and
qualification based on verifiable assets located in the United States.

     Commercial Real Estate and Multi-Family Lending. BankUnited's commercial
real estate lending division originates or participates in multi-family and
commercial real estate loans. BankUnited sells a participating interest in the
majority of the larger loans for risk management purposes in the normal course
of business. The lending policy limits the Bank's risk to $25 million for a
single loan and no more than $40 million to a single borrower. BankUnited's
strategy is to promote commercial lending together with private banking, as both
areas seek to develop long-term relationships with select businesses, real
estate investors, and professionals. At September 30, 2000, BankUnited had
$226.4

                                       10
<PAGE>

million of commercial real estate loans and multi-family loans, representing a
total of 6.17% of BankUnited's loan portfolio before net items.

     BankUnited's commercial real estate loan portfolio includes loans secured
by apartment buildings, office buildings, industrial/warehouses, retail centers
and other properties, which are located in BankUnited's primary market area.
Commercial real estate loans generally are originated in amounts up to 75% of
the appraised value of the property securing the loan. Because commercial real
estate and commercial lending requests are generally more complicated and
involve larger dollar amounts, evaluation of such credit requests continues to
rely on traditional credit analysis, including income projection, participation
by the buyer, breakeven analysis and internal and external collateral
evaluations. In determining whether to originate or purchase multi-family or
commercial real estate loans, BankUnited also considers such factors as the
financial condition and track record of the borrower, and the debt service
coverage of the property. Commercial real estate loans are made at both fixed
and adjustable interest rates, typically for terms of less than 60 months, but
may be up to 15 years.

     Loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family properties
generally involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential
mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans typically involve large loan
balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In
addition, the payment experience on loans secured by income-producing properties
usually depends on the successful operation of the real estate project that
secures the loans and, thus, may be subject, to a greater extent, to adverse
conditions in the real estate market or in the economy, particularly the
interest rate environment.

     Real Estate Construction Lending. BankUnited makes real estate construction
loans to individuals for the construction of their residences, as well as to
builders and real estate developers for the construction of one-to-four-family
residences and commercial and multi-family real estate. At September 30, 2000,
BankUnited had $38.8 million of construction loans representing a total of 1.1%
of BankUnited's loan portfolio before net items. Construction loans to
individuals for their private residences are structured to be converted to
permanent loans with the Bank at the end of the construction phase. Such
residential construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to the same
guidelines used for originating permanent residential mortgage loans. The Bank's
residential construction loans typically have terms of up to nine months and
have rates higher than permanent residential mortgage loans offered by the Bank.
During the construction phase, the borrower pays interest only. Generally, the
maximum loan-to-value ratio of an owner occupied single-family construction loan
is 90%.

     The Bank makes construction loans on commercial real estate projects
secured by apartments, retail centers, industrial warehouse properties, office
buildings, medical facilities or other property. These loans are structured to
be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase, which
generally runs from 12 to 24 months. These construction loans have rates, which
are higher than permanent commercial real estate loans currently offered by the
Bank and the terms are generally consistent with those of permanent loans. These
loans generally provide for the payment of interest and loan fees from loan
proceeds. The loans are underwritten to the same standards as commercial real
estate loans described above. Because of the uncertainties inherent in
estimating construction costs and the market for the project upon completion, it
is often difficult to determine the total loan funds that will be required to
complete a project, the related loan-to-value ratios and the likelihood of
ultimate success of a project. Construction loans to borrowers other than
owner-occupants also involve many of the same risks discussed above regarding
commercial real estate loans and tend to be more sensitive to general economic
conditions than many other types of loans.

     Land. BankUnited makes land loans to individuals for the purchase of land
for their residences, as well as to builders and real estate developers for
purchase of land for future commercial development.

                                       11
<PAGE>

Generally, the Bank requires for all land loans that they be developed within
twelve to eighteen months. As a matter of policy the Bank does not make
speculative land loans. At September 30, 2000, BankUnited had $34.5 million of
land loans representing a total of 0.9% of BankUnited's loan portfolio before
net items.

     Commercial Business and Small Business Lending. Commercial and small
business loans totaled $83.0 million as of September 30, 2000, representing 2.3
% of total loans before net items. Commercial business loans are made to
companies with annual sales revenue in excess of $5.0 million in BankUnited's
market area. Small business loans are made to companies with annual sales
revenue less than $5.0 million and the loans do not typically exceed $1.0
million. BankUnited also offers payroll and merchant services through outside
vendors, as well as in-house treasury management services. BankUnited makes both
secured and unsecured loans, although the majority of these loans are on a
secured basis. Accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, and/or general
corporate assets of the borrowers, as well as the personal guarantee of the
principal typically secure the loans. The loans typically have fixed and
variable prime-based interest rates and are originated for terms ranging from 1
to 5 years. In its loan underwriting, BankUnited evaluates the value of the
collateral securing the loan and assesses the borrower's creditworthiness and
ability to repay. A credit scoring approval is used, and exceptions to credit
policy guidelines are discouraged, but may be available depending on all the
circumstances. While these loans generally are made for shorter terms and at
higher yields than one-to-four-family residential loans, such loans generally
involve a higher level of risk than one-to-four-family residential loans because
the risk of borrower default is greater and the collateral may be more difficult
to liquidate and more likely to decline in value.

     Consumer Lending. Consumer loans totaled $66.5 million as of September 30,
2000, representing 1.8% of total loans before net items. This portfolio consists
primarily of automobile loans and home equity lines of credit. During fiscal
1999, BankUnited ceased its strategy of purchasing indirect paper from auto
dealers and shifted its emphasis to primarily home equity lines and consumer
loans. Consumer loans, with the exception of home equity lines of credit, are
offered primarily on a fixed-rate, short-term basis. The underwriting standards
employed by BankUnited for consumer loans include a determination of the
applicant's payment history on other debts, an assessment of the borrower's
ability to make payments on the proposed loan and other indebtedness and a
review of the value of the security. In addition, BankUnited utilizes an on-line
application and credit scoring system to assist in determining an applicant's
creditworthiness. BankUnited's consumer loans tend to have higher interest rates
and shorter maturities than one-to-four family residential loans because the
risk of borrower default is greater and the collateral is more likely to decline
in value.

     BankUnited's home equity lines of credit are originated on owner-occupied,
one-to-four family residential properties. These loans are generally limited to
aggregate outstanding indebtedness secured by up to 90% of the appraised value
of the property. Such lines are underwritten based upon guidelines established
by BankUnited in order to evaluate the borrower's ability and willingness to
repay the debt.

Asset Quality

     Federal regulations require a savings institution to review its assets on a
regular basis and, if appropriate, to classify assets as "substandard,"
"doubtful," or "loss" depending on the likelihood of loss. General allowances
for loan losses are required to be established for assets classified as
substandard or doubtful. For assets classified as loss, the institution must
either establish specific allowances equal to the amount classified as a loss or
charge off such amount. Assets that do not require classification as substandard
but that possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving
management's close attention are required to be designated as "special mention."
The deputy director of the appropriate OTS regional office may approve,
disapprove or modify any classifications of assets and any allowance for

                                       12
<PAGE>

loan losses established. BankUnited's Portfolio Management Committee reviews and
classifies BankUnited's assets and reports the results to the Board of Directors
monthly.

     Additionally, under standard banking practices, an institution's asset
quality is also measured by the level of non-performing loans in the
institution's portfolio and real estate acquired in foreclosure ("REO").
Non-performing loans consist of (i) non-accrual loans; (ii) loans that are more
than 90 days contractually past due as to interest or principal but that are
well-secured and (iii) loans that have been renegotiated to provide a deferral
of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial condition
of the borrower. BankUnited issues delinquency notices to borrowers when loans
are 30 or more days past due, and places these loans on non-accrual status when
more than 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status,
BankUnited reverses all accrued and uncollected interest and also begins
appropriate legal procedures to obtain repayment of the loan or otherwise
satisfy the obligation.

     As of September 30, 2000, BankUnited had $23.9 million in substandard
assets of which $23.5 million are classified as non-performing assets.
Substandard assets consisted of the following:

     In addition, $517,000 of commercial business loans for which reserves have
been established were classified as loss as of September 30, 2000.

     BankUnited's allowance for loan losses is established and maintained based
upon management's evaluation of the risks inherent in BankUnited's loan
portfolio including the economic trends and other conditions in specific
geographic areas as they relate to the nature of BankUnited's portfolio.
BankUnited's one-to four family residential loans and consumer loans are
homogeneous in nature and no single loan is individually significant in terms of
its size or potential risk of loss. Therefore, management evaluates these loans
as a group of loans. Management utilizes historical loan losses, current trends
in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan administration and
resolution, the views of its regulators, and other relevant factors, such as
assumptions and projections of future conditions in order to determine the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on these loans. For commercial real
estate loans, an estimated value of the property or collateral securing the loan
is determined through an appraisal, where possible. In instances where
BankUnited has not taken possession of the property or does not otherwise have
access to the premises and therefore cannot obtain an appraisal, a real estate
broker's opinion as to the value of the property is obtained based primarily on
a drive-by inspection. If the unpaid balance of the loan is greater than the
estimated fair value of the property, a reserve is established for the
difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Other loans
such as non-mortgage commercial loans are evaluated individually as well. For
these loans, a determination is made of the value of the collateral, if any,
through examination of current financial information. If the unpaid balance of
the loan is greater than estimated fair value of the property, a reserve is
established for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair
value.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     General valuation allowances are also established on all classes of the
performing portfolio and represent loss allowances that have been established to
recognize the unspecified losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In determining
the adequacy of the unallocated reserves, management considers changes in the
size and composition of the loan portfolio, historical loan loss experience,
current and anticipated economic conditions and BankUnited's credit
administration and asset management philosophies and procedures.

     The above-described method of establishing an adequate provision for the
allowance for loan losses inherently lacks precision. Because of the many
factors that can affect recoverability, the estimated loss on an individual loan
or group of loans may not be the same as the ultimate loss, if any, actually
sustained. BankUnited performs the reserve analysis on a monthly basis which
provides a mechanism for ensuring that estimated losses reasonably approximate
ultimate losses, as any differences between estimated losses and ultimate losses
will be immediately addressed in the evaluation and resulting loan loss
provision. See "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Asset Quality."

Investments and Mortgage-backed Securities

     BankUnited maintains an investment portfolio consisting primarily of
federal agency securities, trust preferred securities and tax certificates.
Federal regulations limit the instruments in which BankUnited may invest its
funds. BankUnited's current investment policy permits purchases primarily of
investments rated in one of the three highest grades by a nationally recognized
rating agency.

     Mortgage-backed securities are primarily acquired for their liquidity,
yield, and credit characteristics. Such securities may be used as collateral for
borrowing or pledged as collateral for certain deposits, including public funds
deposits. Mortgage-backed securities acquired include fixed and adjustable rate
agency securities (GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC), private issue securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations.

     BankUnited's portfolio also includes tax certificates issued by various
counties in the State of Florida. Tax certificates represent tax obligations
that are auctioned by county taxing authorities on an annual basis in order to
collect delinquent real estate taxes. Although tax certificates have no stated
maturity, the certificate holder has the right to collect the delinquent tax
amount, plus interest, and can file for a tax deed if the delinquent tax amount
is unpaid at the end of two years. Tax certificates have a claim superior to
most other liens. If the holder does not file for deed within seven years, the
certificate becomes null and void. BankUnited discontinued purchasing tax
certificates in fiscal 1999.

     Also included in BankUnited's investment portfolio are trust preferred
securities issued by affiliates of FDIC-insured financial institutions or their
holding companies. Such securities are primarily acquired for their liquidity
and yield characteristics.

Mortgage Loan Servicing

     BankUnited's mortgage loans servicing agreements generally provide for loan
servicing fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum of the declining principal
amount of the loans, plus any late charges or other ancillary fees. Loan
servicing fees for loans serviced under mortgage-backed securities programs are
either subject to negotiation with the sponsoring agency or in certain instances
set by the sponsoring agency. Servicing fees for loans sold to private investors
are determined by agreement with the investor. Income from servicing is
calculated based upon the contractual servicing fee, net of amortization of the
carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights. At September 30, 2000 and 1999
BankUnited serviced mortgage loans for investors with unpaid principal balances
of approximately $343.6 million and $421.8 million respectively, which are not
reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.

     BankUnited is subject to certain costs and risks related to servicing
delinquent loans. Servicing agreements relating to the mortgage-backed security
programs of FNMA and FHLMC require the servicer to advance funds to make
scheduled payments of interest, taxes and insurance, and in some instances
principal, if such payments have not been received from the borrowers. However,
BankUnited recovers substantially all of the advanced funds upon cure of default
by the borrower, or through foreclosure proceedings and claims against agencies
or companies that have insured or guaranteed the loans. Certain servicing
agreements for loans sold directly to other investors require BankUnited to
remit funds to the loan purchaser only upon receipt of payments from the
borrower and, accordingly, the investor bears the risk of loss. BankUnited,
however, is subject to the risk that declines in the market rates of interest
for mortgage loans or other economic conditions will result in a revaluation of
its servicing assets as borrowers refinance or otherwise prepay higher interest
rate loans (See "Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market
Risk").

Sources of Funds

     BankUnited's primary sources of funds for its investment and lending
activities are customer deposits, loan repayments, funds from operations,
BankUnited's capital (including trust preferred securities), Senior Notes and
FHLB advances.

     Deposits. BankUnited offers a full variety of deposit accounts ranging from
passbook accounts to certificates of deposit with maturities of up to five
years. BankUnited also offers transaction accounts, which include personal and
commercial checking accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal ("NOW") accounts,
insured money market deposit accounts and the Diamond Program accounts. The
Diamond Program is a package account that offers a suite of financial services.
The rates paid on deposits are established periodically by management based on
BankUnited's need for funds and the rates being offered by BankUnited's
competitors with the goal of remaining competitive without offering the highest
rates in the market area.

     BankUnited has placed increasing reliance on passbook accounts, money
market accounts, short term certificates of deposit and other savings
alternatives that are more responsive to market conditions than long-term,
fixed-rate certificates. While market-sensitive savings instruments permit
BankUnited to reduce its cost of funds during periods of declining interest
rates, such savings instruments also increase BankUnited's vulnerability to
periods of high interest rates. There are no regulatory interest rate ceilings
on BankUnited's accounts (See "Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure
about Market Risk").

     Included in the table of jumbo certificate accounts above, are $281.3
million in certificates of deposit issued to the State of Florida, referred to
as public funds, which have interest rates ranging from 4.19% to 7.21%. These
certificates are collateralized with GNMA, FNMA, and FHLMC mortgage backed
securities with market values of approximately $147 million at September 30,
2000.

     Of BankUnited's total deposits, excluding public funds, at September 30,
2000, 1999 and 1998, 16.8%, 13%, and 12.3%, respectively, were deposits of
$100,000 or more issued to the general public. Although jumbo certificates of
deposit are generally more rate sensitive than smaller size deposits, management
believes that BankUnited will retain many of these deposits.

     Borrowings. When BankUnited's primary sources of funds are not sufficient
to meet deposit outflows, loan originations and purchases and other cash
requirements, BankUnited may borrow funds from the FHLB of Atlanta and from
other sources. The FHLB system acts as an additional source of funding for
financial institutions. In addition, BankUnited uses subordinated notes,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and trust preferred securities in
order to increase available funds.

      FHLB borrowings, known as "advances," are made on a secured basis, and the
terms and rates charged for FHLB advances vary in response to general economic
conditions. As a shareholder of the FHLB of Atlanta, the Bank is authorized to
apply for advances from this bank. FHLB of Atlanta offers a wide variety of
borrowing plans, each with its own maturity and interest rate. A significant
portion of BankUnited's advances were obtained through a convertible advances
program that permits the FHLB to convert an advance from a fixed-rate basis to a
floating-rate basis at its discretion on a specified "call" date which generally
occurs every three months following an initial period ranging from three months
to three years. Should the FHLB elect to exercise this option, BankUnited can
either accept the converted advance or repay it in full.

     BankUnited also has advances under the FHLB "knockout" advance program. In
general, a knockout advance is structured as a fixed rate advance that the FHLB
may convert to a floating rate indexed to the 3-month LIBOR rate if, at the end
of any given three month period after the non-conversion period, the 3-month
LIBOR rate equals or exceeds an agreed upon threshold rate. Should a particular
advance be converted by the FHLB, its rate will reset quarterly for the
remainder of the term.

      The FHLB of Atlanta will consider various factors, including an
institution's regulatory capital position, net income, quality and composition
of assets, lending policies and practices, and level of current borrowings from
all sources, in determining the amount of credit to extend to an institution. In
addition, an institution that fails to meet the qualified thrift lender test may
have restrictions imposed on its ability to obtain FHLB advances. The Bank
currently meets the qualified thrift lender test.

     During the 1997 and 1998 fiscal years, BankUnited issued an aggregate of
$227.2 million in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures, which were
purchased by its Delaware trust subsidiaries primarily with proceeds from the
sale of trust preferred securities. See Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for a description of the Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures and the trust preferred securities. In November 1999, the Board of
Directors of BankUnited authorized the purchase from time to time in the open
market, or otherwise, of up to 300,000 shares of trust preferred securities
issued by BankUnited's trust subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2000 BankUnited
had purchased a total of 158,499 shares of trust preferred securities issued by
its trust subsidiaries on the open market at a cost of $4.4 million.

     During November 1998, the Bank established a medium-term note program which
permits the issuance, from time to time, of up to a total of $500 million
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, with maturities from 9 months to
10 years from the date of issuance. As a condition of issuance, interest,
principal and any redemption premium on all offered Senior Notes are supported
by an irrevocable standby letter of credit of the FHLB of Atlanta. The Senior
Notes provide an additional source of funding, potentially with longer
maturities with attractive rates. In February 1999, the Bank issued and sold
$200 million of Senior Notes that mature five years from the date of issuance
and bear interest at an annual rate of 5.40% payable semiannually. The Bank used
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for general corporate purposes, loan
financing, and assisting in the Bank's asset/liability management. The notes
have been rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and "AAA" by Standard
and Poor's Rating Services.

     Securities sold under agreements to repurchase is another source of
borrowed funds which is available to BankUnited. Under this type of borrowing,
securities are pledged against borrowed funds and are released when the funds
are repaid. BankUnited uses this type of borrowing alternative short term as
maturities are

                                       19

usually within thirty to sixty days from inception. At September 30, 2000
BankUnited held $9.2 million in repurchase agreements which matured overnight
and had $11.1 million in investments and mortgage-backed securities pledged
against these agreements.

     The following tables set forth information as to BankUnited's borrowings as
of the dates and for the periods indicated.

REGULATION

General

     BankUnited is a unitary savings and loan holding company and is subject to
OTS regulations, examination, supervision and reporting requirements pursuant to
certain provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act (the "HOLA") and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA"). As an insured institution and a subsidiary
of a savings and loan holding company, the Bank is subject to extensive
regulation and examination by the OTS, its primary federal regulator and its
deposit accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC") through the Savings Association Insurance Fund (the "SAIF").

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulations

     Activities Limitations. Because BankUnited is a unitary savings and loan
holding company which was in existence or applied for before May 4, 1999, and
the Bank meets the definition of a qualified thrift lender ("QTL"), as discussed
below, BankUnited generally has the broadest authority to engage in various
types of business activities, including nonfinancial activities. The
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ("GLB"), which became law in November 1999 prohibits
companies that become unitary savings and loan holding companies pursuant to an
application filed with the OTS after May 4, 1999 from engaging in nonfinancial
activities or affiliating with nonfinancial entities. In addition, a holding
company that acquires another institution and maintains it as a separate
subsidiary or whose sole subsidiary fails to meet the QTL test will become
subject to the activities limitations applicable to multiple savings and loan
holding companies.

     The Director of the OTS has oversight authority for all holding company
affiliates, and is authorized under federal law to take enforcement action if
there is reasonable cause to believe that the continuation by a savings bank
holding company of any particular activity constitutes a serious risk to the
financial safety, soundness, or stability of the holding company's subsidiary
savings institution. The Director of the OTS may, as necessary, limit the
payment of dividends by the savings institution, limit transactions between the
savings institution, the holding company and the subsidiaries or affiliates of
either or limit any activities of the savings institution that might create a
serious risk that the liabilities of the holding company and its affiliates may
be imposed on the savings institution.

     Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between the Bank and its
affiliates are regulated under the HOLA and OTS regulations, which incorporate
Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O
adopted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal
Reserve Board"). An "affiliate" of a savings institution generally includes
entities controlling the savings institution and entities under common control
with the institution. BankUnited and its subsidiaries, therefore, are affiliates
of the Bank under these regulations.

     The laws and regulations governing affiliate transactions require that
covered transactions and certain other transactions with affiliates be on terms
and conditions consistent with safe and

                                       22
<PAGE>

sound banking practices which are substantially the same, or at least as
favorable to the institution or its subsidiary, as those for comparable
transactions with non-affiliated parties. These laws and regulations also impose
quantitative restrictions on the amount of covered transactions in which an
institution may engage and set collateralization requirements on covered
transactions. "Covered transactions" generally include loans or extensions of
credit to an affiliate, purchases of securities issued by an affiliate,
purchases of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or
regulation), and certain other transactions. In addition, a savings institution
is prohibited from extending credit to an affiliate (other than a subsidiary of
the institution), unless the affiliate is engaged only in activities that the
Federal Reserve Board has determined, by regulation, to be permissible for bank
holding companies. Limitations are also imposed on loans and extensions of
credit from an institution to its executive officers, directors and principal
shareholders and each of their related interests.

     Acquisitions. The HOLA prohibits a savings bank holding company from
directly or indirectly acquiring, without prior OTS approval, control of a
savings association or savings association holding company, all or substantially
all of the assets of a savings association or savings association holding
company (including through an acquisition by merger, consolidation or purchase
of assets, of any savings association), or more than 5% of the voting shares of
a non-subsidiary savings association or savings association holding company. In
determining whether to approve any such transaction, the OTS will consider,
among other things, the competitive effects of the transaction, financial and
managerial resources, future prospects of the holding company and its bank or
thrift subsidiaries following the transaction, and compliance records of such
subsidiaries with the Community Reinvestment Act.

     Annual Reporting and Examinations. Under HOLA and OTS regulations, a
savings bank holding company must file periodic reports with the OTS and comply
with OTS recordkeeping requirements. BankUnited is also subject to holding
company examination by the OTS.

Savings Institution Regulations

     Federal savings institutions such as the Bank are chartered by the OTS, are
members of the FHLB system, and have their deposits insured by the SAIF. They
are subject to comprehensive OTS and FDIC regulations that are intended
primarily to protect depositors. Federal laws empower federal savings
institutions like the Bank to accept deposits and pay interest on them, make
loans on residential and other real estate, make limited amounts of consumer
loans and commercial loans, invest in corporate obligations, government debt
securities and other securities, offer various banking services to their
customers, and engage in, directly or through subsidiaries, activities such as
trust operations and real estate investment, subject to applicable requirements
for notice to, or approval by, the institution's primary federal regulator.
SAIF-insured, federally chartered institutions may not enter into certain
transactions unless applicable regulatory tests are met or they obtain necessary
approvals. They are also required to file reports with the OTS describing their
activities and financial condition, and periodic examinations by the OTS test
compliance by institutions with various regulatory requirements, some of which
are described below.

                                       23
<PAGE>

     Insurance of Accounts. The Bank's deposits are insured by the SAIF up to
$100,000 for each insured account holder, subject to applicable terms and
conditions, the maximum amount currently permitted by law.

     As an insurer, the FDIC issues regulations and conducts examinations of its
insured members. SAIF insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC, after
notice and hearing, upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and
unsound practices, cannot continue operations because it is in an unsafe and
unsound condition, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order
or condition imposed by the OTS or FDIC. When conditions warrant, the FDIC may
impose less severe sanctions as an alternative to termination of insurance. The
Bank's management does not know of any present condition pursuant to which the
FDIC would seek to impose sanctions on the Bank or terminate insurance of its
deposits.

     The FDIC's deposit insurance premiums are assessed through a risk-based
system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of
nine categories and assessed insurance premiums based upon their level of
capital and supervisory evaluation. Under the system, institutions which the
FDIC considers well capitalized and financially sound pay the lowest premium,
while institutions that are less than adequately capitalized and of substantial
supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured
institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period. The
FDIC is authorized to increase or decrease assessment rates on a semiannual
basis, up to a maximum increase or decrease of 5 basis points after aggregating
all increases and decreases, if it determines that the reserve ratio of the SAIF
will be less than the designated reserve ratio of 1.25% of SAIF insured
deposits. In setting these increased assessments, the FDIC must seek to restore
the reserve ratio to that designated reserve level, or such higher reserve ratio
as is established by the FDIC. The FDIC may also impose special assessments on
SAIF members to repay amounts borrowed from the United States Treasury or for
any other reason deemed necessary by the FDIC.

                                       24
<PAGE>

     In September 1996, Congress enacted legislation to eliminate any
competitive disadvantage between the Bank Insurance Fund (the "BIF") and SAIF
member institutions, from SAIF deposit insurance premiums, which were generally
higher than BIF deposit insurance premiums. The legislation provided for a
one-time assessment to be imposed on all deposits assessed at the SAIF rates, as
of March 31, 1995, in order to recapitalize the SAIF. As a result of the special
assessment, the Bank's deposit insurance premiums were initially reduced to 6.7
basis points, and as of 1996 the SAIF deposit assessment was reduced to zero.
These premiums are subject to change in future periods.

     In addition to deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC is authorized to
collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the Finance
Corporation ("FICO") to service FICO debt incurred in the 1980s. The FICO
assessment rate is adjusted quarterly. Before 2000, the FICO assessment rate for
SAIF-insured deposits was five times higher than the rate for BIF-insured
deposits. Beginning in 2000, SAIF- and BIF-insured deposits are being assessed
at the same rate by FICO. During fiscal 2000, the annualized rate was $0.02
cents per $100 of insured deposits.

     Regulatory Capital Requirements. OTS regulations incorporate a risk-based
capital requirement that is designed to be no less stringent than the capital
standard applicable to national banks. It is modeled in many respects on, but
not identical to, the risk-based capital requirements adopted by the FDIC.
Associations whose exposure to interest-rate risk is deemed to be above normal
will be required to deduct a portion of such exposure in calculating their
risk-based capital. The OTS may establish, on a case-by-case basis, individual
minimum capital requirements for a savings association that vary from the
requirements that otherwise would apply under the OTS capital regulations. The
OTS has not established such individual minimum capital requirements for the
Bank, and, as of September 30, 2000, the Bank exceeded all applicable regulatory
requirements. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under current law
and regulations, there are no capital requirements directly applicable to
BankUnited.

     In addition, the OTS and other federal banking regulators have established
capital levels for institutions to implement the "prompt corrective action"
provisions of the FDICIA. Based on these capital levels, insured institutions
will be categorized as well capitalized, adequately capitalized,
undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized.
If an institution becomes categorized as "undercapitalized" under the
definitions established by the "prompt corrective action" provisions of the
FDICIA, it will become subject to certain restrictions. The FDICIA requires
federal banking regulators, including the OTS, to take prompt corrective action
to solve the problems of those institutions that fail to satisfy their
applicable minimum capital requirements. The level of regulatory scrutiny and
restrictions imposed become increasingly severe as an institution's capital
level falls.

     An institution's category depends upon where its capital levels are in
relation to relevant capital measures, which include a risk-based capital
measure, a leverage ratio capital measure, and certain other factors. A "well
capitalized" institution must have a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted
assets (a "total risk-based capital ratio") of 10% or more, a ratio of core
capital to risk-weighted assets ("Tier I risk-based capital ratio") of 6% or
more and a ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets ("Tier 1 leverage
ratio") of 5% or more, and may not be subject to any

                                       25
<PAGE>

written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action
directive issued by the OTS. An institution will be categorized as "adequately
capitalized" if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or more, a Tier 1
risk-based capital ratio of 4% or more, and either a leverage ratio of 4% or
more or a leverage ratio of 3% or more and a CAMEL rating of 1. Any institution
that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized will be considered
undercapitalized. The Bank is a well capitalized institution under the
definitions as adopted.

     In the case of an institution that is categorized as "undercapitalized," or
worse, such an institution must submit a capital restoration plan to the OTS. An
undercapitalized depository institution generally will not be able to acquire
other banks or thrifts, establish additional branches, pay dividends, or engage
in any new lines of business unless consistent with its capital plan. A
"significantly undercapitalized" institution will be subject to additional
restrictions on its affiliate transactions, the interest rates paid by the
institution on its deposits, the institution's asset growth, compensation of
senior executive officers, and activities deemed to pose excessive risk to the
institution. Regulators may also order a significantly undercapitalized
institution to hold elections for new directors, terminate any director or
senior executive officer employed for more than 180 days prior to the time the
institution became significantly undercapitalized, or hire qualified senior
executive officers approved by the regulators.

     The FDICIA provides that an institution that is "critically
undercapitalized" must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90
days of becoming categorized as such unless the institution's regulator and the
FDIC jointly determine that some other course of action would result in a lower
resolution cost to the institution's insurance fund. Thereafter, the
institution's regulator must periodically reassess its determination to permit a
particular critically undercapitalized institution to continue to operate. A
conservator or receiver must be appointed for the institution at the end of an
approximately one-year period following the institution's initial classification
as critically undercapitalized unless a number of stringent conditions are met,
including a determination by the regulator and the FDIC that the institution has
positive net worth and a certification by such agencies that the institution is
viable and not expected to fail.

     Federal law requires that the federal banking agencies risk-based capital
guidelines take into account various factors including interest rate risk,
concentration of credit risk, risks associated with nontraditional activities,
and the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multi-family mortgages.
In 1994, the federal banking agencies jointly revised their capital standards to
specify that concentration of credit and nontraditional activities are among the
factors that the agencies will consider in evaluating capital adequacy. In that
year, the OTS and FDIC amended their risk-based capital standards with respect
to the risk weighting of loans made to finance the purchase or construction of
multi-family residences. The OTS adopted final regulations adding an interest
rate risk component to the risk-based capital requirements for savings
associations such as the Bank, although implementation of the regulation has
been delayed. Management believes that the effect of including such an interest
rate risk component in the calculation of risk-adjusted capital will not cause
the Bank to cease to be well-capitalized.

     The final rules establishing the capital levels for purposes of the FDICIA
also indicate that the federal regulators intend to lower or eliminate the core
capital requirement from the definitions of well capitalized, adequately
capitalized and undercapitalized after the requirement to deduct an IRR
component from total capital becomes effective. This action has not yet been
taken. See "Regulatory Capital Requirements" above.

                                       26
<PAGE>

     In addition to the foregoing prompt corrective action provisions, the
FDICIA also sets forth requirements that the federal banking agencies, including
the OTS, review their capital standards every two years to ensure that their
standards require sufficient capital to facilitate prompt corrective action and
to minimize loss to the SAIF and the BIF.

     Restrictions on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions. OTS Regulations
limit the ability of savings institutions to pay dividends and make other
capital distributions. Savings institutions, such as the Bank, which are
subsidiaries of a savings and loan holding company, must provide the OTS with at
least 30 days written notice before declaring any dividend or obtaining board
approval of any capital distribution. All such capital distributions are also
subject to the OTS' right to object on safety and soundness grounds.

     In addition, a savings institution must obtain prior approval from the OTS
if (i) it fails to meet certain regulatory conditions which qualify it for
expedited treatment under OTS regulations, (ii) after giving effect to the
proposed distribution, the association's capital distributions in a calendar
year would exceed its year-to-date net income plus retained net income for the
preceding two years, (iii) the association would not be at least adequately
capitalized following the distribution, or (iv) the distribution would violate a
statute, regulation, regulatory agreement or a regulatory condition to which the
association is subject. The OTS may disapprove a notice or deny an application,
in whole or in part, if the association would be undercapitalized or worse after
the distribution, if the OTS determines that the distribution raises safety or
soundness concerns, or if the distribution violates any applicable statute,
regulation, agreement between the OTS and the association or condition imposed
by an OTS-approved application or notice.

     Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home
Loan Bank ("FHLB") system, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs governed and
regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Board. The FHLBs provide a central
credit facility for member institutions, The Bank, as a member of the FHLB of
Atlanta, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB of
Atlanta in an amount at least equal to the greater of 1% of the aggregate
principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase
contracts and similar obligations as of the close of each calendar year, or 5%
of its borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta (including advances and letters of
credit issued by the FHLB on the Bank's behalf). The Bank is currently in
compliance with this requirement, with a $62.6 million investment in stock of
the FHLB of Atlanta as of September 30, 2000.

     The FHLB of Atlanta makes advances to members in accordance with policies
and procedures periodically established by the Federal Housing Finance Board and
the Board of Directors of the FHLB of Atlanta. Currently outstanding advances
from the FHLB of Atlanta are required to be secured by a member's shares of
stock in the FHLB of Atlanta and by certain types of mortgages and other assets.
Eligible collateral is further limited in certain respects. Interest rates
charged for advances vary depending on maturity, the cost of funds to the FHLB
of Atlanta and the purpose of the borrowing. As of September 30, 2000, advances
from the FHLB of Atlanta totaled $1.3 billion.

     Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The qualified thrift lender test measures the
proportion of a savings institution's assets invested in loans or securities
supporting residential

                                       27
<PAGE>

construction and home ownership. A savings institution qualifies as a QTL if its
qualified thrift investments equal or exceed 65% of its portfolio assets on a
monthly average basis in nine of every 12 months. Qualified thrift investments,
include (i) certain housing-related loans and investments, (ii) certain
obligations of the FSLIC, the FDIC, the FSLIC Resolution Fund and the RTC, (iii)
loans to purchase or construct churches, schools, nursing homes and hospitals
(subject to certain limitations), (iv) consumer loans (subject to certain
limitations), (v) shares of stock issued by any FHLB, and (vi) shares of stock
issued by the FHLMC or the FNMA (subject to certain limitations). Portfolio
assets consist of total assets minus (a) goodwill and other intangible assets,
(b) the value of properties used by the savings institution to conduct its
business, and (c) certain liquid assets in an amount not exceeding 20% of total
assets.

     Any savings institution that fails to become or remain a QTL must either
convert to a national bank charter or be subject to restrictions specified in
the OTS regulations. Any such savings institution that does not become a bank
will be: (i) prohibited from making any new investment or engaging in activities
that would not be permissible for national banks; (ii) prohibited from
establishing any new branch office in a location that would not be permissible
for a national bank in the institution's home state; (iii) ineligible to obtain
new advances from any FHLB; and (iv) subject to limitations on the payment of
dividends comparable to the statutory and regulatory dividend restrictions
applicable to national banks. Also, beginning three years after the date on
which the savings association ceases to be a QTL, the savings association will
be prohibited from retaining any investment or engaging in any activity not
permissible for a national bank and would be required to repay any outstanding
advances to any FHLB. A savings institution may requalify as a QTL if it
thereafter complies with the QTL test. At September 30, 2000, the Bank exceeded
the QTL requirements.

     Liquidity. OTS regulations currently require member savings institutions to
maintain for each calendar quarter an average daily balance of liquid assets
(cash and certain time deposits, securities of certain mutual funds, bankers'
acceptances, corporate debt securities and commercial paper, and specified U.S.
government, state government and federal agency obligations) equal to at least
4% of either the amount of its liquidity base at the end of the preceding
calendar quarter or the average daily balance of its liquidity base during the
preceding quarter. "Liquidity base" means the institution's net withdrawable
deposits and short-term borrowings (generally borrowings having maturities of
one year or less). The Director of the OTS may vary this liquidity requirement
from time to time within a range of 4% to 10%. Monetary penalties may be imposed
for failure to meet liquidity requirements. For the month of September 2000, the
Bank's liquidity ratio was 8.77%. The Bank is also required to maintain cash
reserve requirements at the Federal Home Loan Bank. At September 30, 2000 this
cash reserve requirement was $13.2 million.

General Lending Regulations

     The Bank's lending activities are subject to federal regulation, including
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act and the Community Reinvestment Act. Because the Bank
is a federally-chartered savings bank, the Bank generally may extend credit as
authorized under federal law, without regard to state laws purporting to
regulate or affect its credit activities, other than state contract and
commercial laws, real property laws, homestead laws, tort laws, criminal laws
and other state laws designated by the OTS.

     Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (the
"CRA"), as implemented by OTS regulations, a savings institution has a
continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound
operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low
and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending
requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an
institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it
believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA.
The CRA requires the OTS, in connection with its examination of a financial
institution, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of
its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain
applications.

     Under regulations adopted by the OTS with the other federal banking
agencies, there are three tests for the evaluation of a savings institution's
performance. The lending test evaluates a savings institution's record of
helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area through its lending
activities, by considering an institution's home mortgage, small business, small
farm, and community development lending. The investment test evaluates a savings
institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its assessment area
through qualified investments that benefit its assessment area or a broader
statewide or regional area including the assessment area, and the service test
evaluates a savings institution by analyzing both the availability and the
effectiveness of the institution's systems for delivering retail banking
services and the extent and innovativeness of its community development
services. Based upon the savings institution's performance under the lending,
investment and service tests, and any other tests which may be applicable to the
institution under the regulations, the OTS assigns the savings institution one
of four ratings prescribed under the regulations. The four possible ratings of
meeting community credit needs are outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve,
and substantial noncompliance. Based upon the OTS examination in fiscal 2000,
the Bank's CRA rating is satisfactory.

     Loans-to-one-borrower Limitations. The loans-to-one borrower limits
applicable to national banks also apply to savings institutions. Generally,
under current limits, loans and extensions of credit outstanding at one time to
a single borrower and not fully secured may not exceed 15% of the savings
institution's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans and extensions of
credit fully secured by certain readily marketable collateral may represent an
additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. As of September 30,
2000, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations.

Federal Reserve System

     The Bank is subject to certain regulations promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board. Pursuant to such regulations, savings institutions are required
to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily
interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing checking accounts) and non-personal
time deposits. The balances maintained to meet the reserve requirements imposed
by the Federal Reserve Board may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements
imposed by the OTS. In addition, Federal Reserve Board regulations limit the
periods within which depository institutions must provide availability for and
pay interest on deposits to transaction accounts. Depository institutions are
required to disclose their check-hold policies and any changes to those policies
in writing to customers. The Bank is in compliance with all such Federal Reserve
Board regulations.

                                       29
<PAGE>

     Numerous other regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board affect
the business operations of the Bank. These include regulations relating to equal
credit opportunity, electronic fund transfers, collection of checks, truth in
lending, truth in savings and availability of funds.

Other Regulation

     Regulation of Non-Banking Affiliates. BUFC Financial Services, Incorporated
("BUFC"), an insurance agency subsidiary of BankUnited doing business in the
State of Florida, sells fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds and long-term
care insurance products. BUFC's activities must comply with Florida insurance
laws and regulations, and BUFC employees are licensed insurance agents and
subject to continuing education, licensing and oversight by the Florida
Department of Insurance. In addition, BUFC's employees are also registered
representatives of Essex National Securities, Inc., a broker-dealer regulated by
the NASD. BUFC's activities are further regulated by regulations and guidelines
jointly adopted by the federal banking agencies, which specify requirements for
the sale of non-deposit insurance products, including, without limitation,
requirements pertaining to disclosures, physical separation of activities from
banking activities and due diligence and oversight functions.

Legislative and Regulatory Developments

     Pursuant to the GLB, the federal banking agencies have jointly adopted a
privacy regulation with which savings institutions must comply on and after July
1, 2001. Subject to certain exceptions, the privacy regulation requires each
financial institution to give a consumer notice of its privacy policies and
practices before disclosing nonpublic personal information about the consumer to
any non-affiliated third party, to give each customer notice of its privacy
policies and procedures at the time a customer relationship is established and
annually thereafter, and to give each consumer an opt out notice and reasonable
opportunity for the customer to opt out of having his nonpublic personal
information disclosed by the financial institution to non-affiliated third
parties. The Bank is in the process of making all necessary and appropriate
preparations to comply with the new privacy requirements.

TAXATION

     BankUnited reports its income and expenses under an accrual method of
accounting and, prior to 1994, filed federal income tax returns on a calendar
year basis. Since 1994, BankUnited and its subsidiaries have elected to file
consolidated tax returns on the basis of a fiscal year ending September 30. The
Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the "1986 Act"), which was signed into law on October
22, 1986, revised the income tax laws applicable to corporations in general and
to savings institutions, such as the Bank, in particular. Except as specifically
noted, the discussion below relates to taxable years beginning after December
31, 1986.

     BankUnited has not been notified of a proposed examination of its federal
income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS").

                                       30

      Bad Debt Reserves Deductions. Prior to legislation enacted in August 1996,
the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") permitted savings institutions, such as
the Bank, to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions
thereto, which additions might, within specified formula limits, be deducted in
determining taxable income. The bad debt reserve deduction was generally based
upon a savings institution's actual loss experience (the "experience method").
In addition, provided that certain definitional tests relating to the
composition of assets and sources of income were met, a savings institution was
permitted to elect annually to compute the allowable addition to its bad debt
reserve for losses on qualifying real property loans (generally loans secured by
improved real estate) by reference to a percentage of its taxable income (the
"percentage of taxable income method").

     Under the percentage of taxable income method, a savings institution was
permitted, in general, to claim a deduction for additions to bad debt reserves
equal to 8% of the savings institution's taxable income. Taxable income for this
purpose was defined as taxable income before the bad debt deduction, but without
regard to any deduction allowable for any addition to the reserve for bad debt.
Certain adjustments were also required for gains on the sale of corporate stock
and tax exempt obligations. For this purpose, the taxable income of a savings
institution for a taxable year was calculated after utilization of net operating
loss carry forwards.

     In August of 1996, legislation was enacted that repealed the reserve method
of accounting (including the percentage of taxable income method) used by many
thrifts, including the Bank, to calculate their bad debt deduction for federal
income tax purposes. The legislation required thrifts to account for bad debts
for federal income tax purposes on the same basis as commercial banks for tax
years beginning after December 31, 1995. As such, thrifts with assets whose tax
basis exceeds $500,000,000 were required to adopt the specific charge off method
in computing its bad debt deduction. As such, the Bank has used the specific
charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax years beginning
after December 31, 1995.

     As a result of this change in accounting method, the Bank must recapture
the excess of its September 30, 1996 bad debt reserve over the reserve in
existence on December 31, 1987. This recapture will occur over a six-year
period, commencing with the first taxable year beginning after December 31,
1997, provided the institution meets certain residential lending requirements.
The management of BankUnited does not believe that the legislation will have a
material impact on BankUnited or the Bank.

     Distributions. Under the Code, the Bank's December 31, 1987 reserve must be
recaptured into taxable income as a result of certain non-dividend
distributions. A distribution is a non-dividend distribution to the extent that,
for federal income tax purposes, (i) it is in redemption of shares, (ii) it is
pursuant to a liquidation of the institution, or (iii) in the case of a current
distribution it, together with all other such distributions during the taxable
year, exceeds the Bank's current and post-1951 accumulated earnings and profits.
The amount charged against the Bank's bad debt reserves in respect of a
distribution will be includable in its gross income and will equal the amount of
such distribution, increased by the amount of federal income tax resulting from
such inclusion.

Alternative Minimum Tax

     In addition to the income tax, corporations are generally subject to an
alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20%. The alternative minimum tax is imposed
on the sum of regular taxable income (with certain adjustments) and tax
preference items, less any available exemption ("AMTI"). The alternative minimum
tax is imposed to the extent that it exceeds a corporation's regular income tax
liability. The items of tax preference that constitute AMTI for 1990 and
thereafter include 75% of the difference between the taxpayer's adjusted current
earnings and AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to any
deduction for net operating loss carry forwards or carry backs). In addition,
net operating loss carry forwards cannot offset more than 90% of AMTI.

Interest Allocable to Tax-exempt Obligations

     The 1986 Act eliminates for financial institutions the deduction for
interest expense allocable to the purchase or carrying of most tax-exempt
obligations for taxable years ending after December 31, 1986, with respect to
tax-exempt obligations acquired after August 7, 1986 excluding certain financial
institution-qualified issues. For all qualified issues and for non-qualified
tax-exempt obligations acquired after 1982 and before August 7, 1986, 20% of
allocable interest expense deductions will be disallowed.

State Taxation

     The State of Florida imposes a corporate income tax on BankUnited, at a
rate of 5.5% of BankUnited's taxable income as determined for Florida income tax
purposes. Taxable income for this purpose is based on federal taxable income
with certain adjustments.

Foreclosures

     Tax legislation enacted in August of 1996 significantly changed the tax
treatment with respect to foreclosures for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 1995. Prior to this legislation, a thrift's acquisition of property
by means of foreclosure was not treated as a taxable event for federal tax
purposes. No gain or loss was recognized at the time of foreclosure and no
portion of the debt could be treated as worthless. In addition, prior to the
August 1996 legislation, thrift institutions were allowed a tax benefit for
write downs of foreclosed property to fair market value. Finally, for thrifts
that computed its bad debt deduction under the experience method, gains or
losses realized from the sale of foreclosed property were not taken into account
in computing taxable income, but were credited or charged to the thrift's bad
debt reserve.

     As a result of enacted tax legislation, thrift foreclosures are treated as
a taxable event for federal tax purposes for property acquired after December
31, 1995. As such, a thrift may recognize gain, loss or a bad debt deduction at
the time of foreclosure depending on the method by which the property was
acquired. In addition, write downs of foreclosed property to fair market value
no longer give rise to a tax benefit. Finally, gains and losses realized upon
the sale of foreclosed property are included in taxable income of the thrift.

Item 2. Properties

     Currently BankUnited operates 32 full-service banking offices located in
South Florida and one in West Florida, of which 30 are leased and three are
owned. BankUnited's banking offices have square footage ranging from 2,000
square feet to 8,000 square feet with lease terms ranging from the year 2001 to
the year 2010.

      BankUnited's executive and administrative offices are located at 255
Alhambra Circle, Coral Gables, Florida 33134 where, as of September 30, 2000,
BankUnited leased approximately 18,000 square feet of space pursuant to a lease
agreement that begins to terminate with respect to portions of the premises in
2004. BankUnited also leases approximately 40,000 square feet of space for its
operation center, which is located at 7815 NW 148 Street, Miami Lakes, Florida
33016, pursuant to a lease agreement that begins to terminate with respect to
portions of the premises in 2002. BankUnited has multiple options to renew
leases at all banking offices and other locations.

     At September 30, 2000, BankUnited leased the facilities of a branch
obtained through the acquisition of Suncoast which was closed in fiscal year
1997. This lease expires in fiscal year 2002. BankUnited owns an office
condominium which is currently not leased.

     For further information regarding BankUnited's lease obligations, see Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     BankUnited and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are involved as
plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of
their businesses. While the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings cannot be
predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management that no proceedings
exist, either individually or in the aggregate, which, if determined adversely
to BankUnited and its subsidiaries, would have a material effect on BankUnited's
consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

     No matters were submitted to a vote of BankUnited's security holders during
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

General

     The following discussion and analysis and the related financial data
present a review of the consolidated operating results and financial condition
of BankUnited for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998. This
discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and
evaluating the financial condition, results of operations and future prospects
of BankUnited, and is intended to supplement, and should be read in conjunction
with, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.

     BankUnited is a Florida-incorporated savings and loan holding company for
the Bank. The Bank was founded in 1984 as a savings and loan association. In
1993, the Bank was converted to a federally chartered savings bank and became a
wholly-owned subsidiary of BankUnited, pursuant to a plan of re-organization
approved by its shareholders. BankUnited's principal business currently consists
of the operation of its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition to
managing the business activities of the Bank, BankUnited invests primarily in
U.S. Government and federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and
other permitted investments. The Bank's primary business has traditionally been
to attract retail deposits from the general public and to invest those deposits,
together with borrowings, principal repayments and other funds, primarily in
one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and to a lesser extent,
mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate mortgage loans, multi-family
mortgage loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans. The Bank has also
invested in other permitted investments. The Bank is subject to the regulations
of certain federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities. References to BankUnited include the activities of all
of its subsidiaries, including the Bank and its subsidiaries, if the context so
requires.

     BankUnited's results of operations are dependent primarily on its net
interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on its
assets, primarily its loan and securities portfolios, and its cost of funds,
which consists of the interest paid on its deposits and borrowings. BankUnited's
results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses as well
as non-interest income, non-interest expenses and income tax expense.
Non-interest expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits, occupancy
and equipment, insurance, professional fees, telecommunications and data
processing, loan servicing expense, and other operating expenses. Results of
operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of
BankUnited's loans and investments.

     In addition to the foregoing, results of BankUnited's operations, like
those of other financial institution holding companies, are affected by
BankUnited's asset and liability management policies, as well as factors beyond
BankUnited's control, such as general economic conditions and the monetary and
fiscal policies of the federal government. Lending activities are affected by
the demand for mortgage financing and other types of loans, which is in turn
affected by the interest rates at which such financings may be offered and other
factors affecting the supply of housing and the availability of funds. Deposit
flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing
investments and by general market rates of interest.

Fiscal 2000 Highlights

     During fiscal 2000 BankUnited increased its asset size to $4.6 billion and
reported record net income of $15 million, resulting in basic earnings of $0.82
and diluted of $0.81 per share. These results reflect the significant
improvement in BankUnited's net interest margin which rose to 1.91% for the
period ended September 30, 2000 from 1.27% for the period ended September 30,
1999.

     During Fiscal 2000, BankUnited opened four new branches. A fifth branch was
opened shortly after year end, bringing the total branches to thirty-three.
BankUnited launched its web site, www.buexpress.com to widen its reach into the
community at reduced cost and offer the alternative delivery channel of Internet
banking services to its customers. BankUnited also launched an aggressive
branding campaign which consisted of radio, print and an award-winning
thirty-second television commercial.

Restructuring

     General

     In December 1998, BankUnited hired a new President and Chief Operating
Officer and subsequently hired a new executive management team, completed a
restructuring and changed its strategy to become an asset-generating entity and
a full service banking institution. The restructuring resulted in $24.5 million
of pre-tax charges which led to a net loss for fiscal 1999. See "Second Quarter
1999 Charges." In the last two quarters of fiscal 1999 and through fiscal 2000,
BankUnited significantly increased loan production, developed enhanced deposit
products and recorded strong earnings. Fiscal 2000 has shown positive results
from the restructuring as assets have increased $473.6 million or 11.6%. Loans
in sectors not previously emphasized by BankUnited have increased over $105
million including commercial real estate which increased $14.5 million,
construction loans which increased $23.3 million and commercial and consumer
which increased $67.5 million. BankUnited posted net income of $15.8 million
before preferred stock dividends.

     Second Quarter 1999 Charges

     BankUnited's restructuring resulted in a special charge of $15.1 million,
as well as a provision for loan losses of $6.3 million, a provision for tax
certificate investment losses of $1.1 million and certain other miscellaneous
charges of $2.0 million resulting in a pre-tax total of $24.5 million of charges
against income.

     Included in the $15.1 million charge was a $14.8 million charge consisting
of $13.0 million of purchase premiums that was required to write down the
carrying value of its purchased One-Year CMT loan portfolio to the lower of cost
or market, and a $1.8 million charge for accelerated amortization of purchase
premiums on a related security. BankUnited's earnings had been severely hampered
during several quarters prior to the restructuring due to the high levels of
prepayments associated with One-Year CMT loans acquired in the secondary market.
As a part of the restructuring, BankUnited decided to reduce its dependence on
the purchase of residential

                                       41
<PAGE>

mortgages in the secondary market, including ending its purchases of One-Year
CMT loans. In addition, all remaining One-Year CMT loans were transferred to
held for sale as of March 31, 1999.

     The restructuring also included a rigorous review of BankUnited's loan
portfolio. This examination resulted in a provision for loan losses of $6.3
million. See "Asset Quality." BankUnited made the decision to discontinue
indirect consumer lending and investing in tax certificates because it was clear
from management's review that BankUnited could not anticipate future benefits
from continuing these lines of business. BankUnited made a $1.1 million
provision for losses on its tax certificate portfolio in connection with its
decision to discontinue this line of business and a review of the quality of the
assets. The miscellaneous charges of $2.0 million included $1.0 million in costs
associated with becoming Year 2000 compliant.

Acquisitions

     On June 19, 1998, BankUnited acquired Central Bank ("Central"), for
1,386,000 shares of BankUnited's Class A Common Stock, and merged Central, which
had assets of $93.9 million and deposits of $65.9 million as of June 19, 1998,
into the Bank.

     On January 23, 1998, BankUnited acquired Consumers Bancorp, Inc.
("Consumers"), for approximately $12.0 million in a combination of cash and
stock, and merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Consumers Savings Bank, which had
assets of $104.4 million and deposits of $88.3 million as of January 23, 1998,
into the Bank.

     See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
regarding these acquisitions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     BankUnited's primary source of funds is cash provided by investing
activities and includes principal and interest payments on loans,
mortgage-backed securities and other securities. For fiscal years ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999, principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed
securities and proceeds from maturities of other securities totaled $657.9
million and $1.4 billion, respectively. During fiscal 1998 BankUnited began
experiencing significant acceleration of prepayments on certain mortgage loans
and mortgage backed securities due to the decrease in long-term interest rates
that continued through the second quarter of fiscal 1999 . During the quarter
ended June 30, 1999, long-term interest rates rose slightly causing the volume
of mortgage loan refinancing to decrease, slowing the prepayment rate of
BankUnited's loan portfolio.

     BankUnited's other sources of funds are provided by financing activities
and includes borrowings and deposits. Net cash provided by financing activities
during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000 increased to $462 million from
$344.9 million, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999. This increase was
mainly attributable to increases in deposits of $330 million, and increased FHLB
advances of $155 million. These increases were offset by a $22 million decrease
in other borrowings. The increase in deposits is attributable to the expansion
of BankUnited's branch network which increased by four new branch locations
during fiscal 2000.

                                       42
<PAGE>

     BankUnited's primary uses of funds in its operating and investing
activities has been the origination of loans and the purchase of mortgage-backed
securities and other securities. During the fiscal year ended September 30,
2000, BankUnited's originations of loans totaled $924.2 million, purchases of
loans totaled $5.5 million and purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other
securities totaled $110.1 million. For the same period in 1999, BankUnited's
originations of loans totaled $723.1 million, purchases of loans totaled $803.3
million and purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other securities totaled
$239.4 million. As previously noted, during the fiscal year ended September 30,
1999 BankUnited decided to reduce its purchases of residential loans in the
secondary market and turned its emphasis to originating its own loans.

     In the normal course of business, BankUnited routinely enters into various
commitments, primarily relating to the origination and purchase of loans, the
purchase of securities and standby letters of credit. Total commitments
outstanding at September 30, 2000 to originate loans were $84.3 million. In
addition, BankUnited had $15.5 million in standby letters of credit outstanding
at September 30, 2000 compared to commitments of $56.9 million and standby
letters of credit outstanding of $6.3 million at September 30, 1999. BankUnited
anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current
commitments in the normal course of business.

     BankUnited's total stockholders' equity was $202.6 million at September 30,
2000, an increase of $12.5 million, or 6.6%, from $190.1 million at September
30, 1999. The increase is due primarily to current year income after preferred
stock dividends of $15 million offset by an increase in accumulated other
comprehensive loss and purchases of treasury stock.

     In December 1998, the Board of Directors of BankUnited authorized the
purchase from time to time in open market transactions of up to 1,000,000 shares
of BankUnited's Class A Common Stock at such prices as the Executive Committee
deems advantageous. At September 30, 1999, BankUnited had purchased 183,000
shares of its Class A Common Stock. During fiscal 2000, BankUnited purchased an
additional 150,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock on the open market at a
cost of $1.1 million, for a total treasury position of 333,000 shares at a cost
of $2.8 million.

     In May 1999, BankUnited's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of
shares of its 9% Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (the "9% Preferred
Stock") on the open market as deemed appropriate and, if the market is
appropriate, the retirement of the 9% Preferred Stock. During fiscal 2000,
BankUnited purchased a total of 1,000 shares of its 9% Preferred Stock on the
open market at a cost of $7,250

     The Bank is required under applicable federal regulations to maintain
specified levels of liquid investments in cash, United States government
securities and other qualifying investments. Regulations currently in effect
require the Bank to maintain liquid assets of not less than 4.0% of its net
demand accounts plus short-term borrowings. In compliance with this requirement
the Bank has liquid assets of 8.77% as of September 30, 2000 and 6.96% as of
September 30, 1999.

     Federal savings banks such as the Bank are also required to maintain
capital at levels specified by applicable minimum capital ratios. At September
30, 2000, the Bank was in

                                       43
<PAGE>

compliance with all capital requirements and met the definition of a "well
capitalized" institution under applicable federal regulations.

Asset Quality

     At September 30, 2000, non-performing assets totaled $25.3 million as
compared to $28.3 million and $22.6 million at September 30, 1999 and 1998,
respectively. Expressed as a percentage of total assets, non-performing assets
decreased to 0.55% as of September 30, 2000 as compared to 0.69% as of September
30, 1999 and 0.61% as of September 30, 1998. The decrease in non-performing
assets in fiscal 2000 primarily resulted from decreases in non-accrual loans and
real estate owned of $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Non-accrual
loans decreased primarily due to a $0.9 million decrease in one-to-four family
residential loan delinquencies and a $3.0 million decrease in commercial
mortgage loan delinquencies. The decrease in real estate owned was due to a
decrease in one-to-four family real estate owned.

(1)  Gross interest income that would have been recorded on non-accrual loans
     had they been current in accordance with original terms was $1.1 million,
     $1.3 million, $1.0 million, $0.6 million, and $0.2 million for the years
     ended September 30, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The
     amount of interest income on such non-accrual loans included in net income
     for the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $0.7
     million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million, $0.4 million, and $0.1 million,
     respectively.
(2)  All restructured loans were accruing.
(3)  In addition, management had concerns as to the borrower's ability to comply
     with present repayment terms on $2.1 million and $6.5 million of accruing
     loans as of September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Management estimates
     that on these loans the loss, if any, will not be significant.
(4)  Based on balances prior to deductions for allowance for loan losses.

     BankUnited's allowance for loan losses is established and maintained based
upon management's evaluation of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio. During
the second quarter of fiscal year 1999, management conducted a review of
BankUnited's interest-earning assets. In connection with this review management
conducted a rigorous review of the loan portfolio, which included a systematic
and detailed evaluation of the estimated loss exposure in BankUnited's loan
portfolio. Management utilized historical loan losses, current trends in
delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan administration and
resolution, the views of its regulators, and other relevant factors, such as
assumptions and projections of future conditions in order to determine the
adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. As a result of

                                       45
<PAGE>

this review some, of the loss presumptions in determining the adequacy of the
allowance for loan losses were revised. The revisions included:

o    Evaluating non-performing one-to-four family residential loans as a group
     of loans rather than individually. Previously, reserves were established
     only on those loans where the unpaid principal balance was greater than 90%
     of the net realizable value. However, since one-to-four family residential
     loans are homogenous in nature and no single loan is individually
     significant in terms of its size or potential risk of loss, reserves are
     now being determined for the group as a whole, based on loss rates
     experienced in the state in which the property is located. This change
     resulted in an additional $2.1 million provision for loan losses in the
     second quarter of fiscal 1999.

o    Evaluating indirect consumer loans as a separate group of loans from direct
     consumer loans. Industry and internal trends have shown that indirect
     consumer loans have a higher loss experience than direct consumer loans. As
     part of the review of interest-earning assets, management made the decision
     to discontinue indirect consumer lending. In connection with this decision,
     and in response to loss trends, management increased its reserves on the
     indirect consumer lending portfolio. This change resulted in an additional
     $0.3 million provision for loan losses in the second quarter of fiscal
     1999.

o    Performing a detailed re-evaluation of the non-performing commercial
     mortgage and non-mortgage commercial loans. The re-evaluation included
     obtaining updated market value information, site visits and a review of the
     loan documentation. The re-evaluation resulted in an additional $3.9
     million provision for loan losses in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.

      In total, the review of interest-earning assets resulted in an additional
provision of $6.3 million in 1999.

     The total provision for fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 was
$4.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively.

     The identification of impaired loans is conducted in conjunction with the
review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Loss allowances are
established for specifically identified impaired loans based on the fair value
of the underlying collateral in accordance with SFAS No. 114.

                                       46
<PAGE>

     Impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a
charge to the provision for loan losses. Adjustments to impairment losses
resulting from changes in the fair value of an impaired loan's collateral are
included in the provision for loan losses. Upon disposition of an impaired loan,
any related valuation allowance is removed from the allowance for loan losses.
The allowance for loan losses is adjusted by additions charged to operations as
a provision for loan losses and by loan recoveries, with actual losses charged
as reductions to the allowance.

for loan losses for the periods indicated:

     Historically, recoveries of charged off loans have been minimal since
charged off loans have been primarily one-to-four family residential loans and
typically the only substantial asset available to BankUnited is the real estate
securing the loan, which is acquired through foreclosure and sold. However, in
its fiscal year ended September 30, 1996, BankUnited received a recovery of
approximately $1.0 million as settlement of litigation BankUnited initiated
against a seller of residential mortgage loans. BankUnited is not aware of any
significant liability related to REO or loans that may be foreclosed.

</TABLE>

     Management believes that the allowance for loan losses of $13.0 million as
of September 30, 2000 is adequate given the strength of BankUnited's collateral
position and the attention given to loan review and classifications. There can
be no assurance that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required
in future periods.

Year 2000

     Computer programs which recognize a date using two digits (rather than
four) to define the applicable year may consider a date using "00" as the year
1900 rather than the year 2000, or fail to recognize the year 2000 as a leap
year. This is generally referred to as the "Year 2000 Issue," which may affect
the performance of computer programs, hardware, software and other products with
embedded computer technology that is date sensitive. In preparation for the Year
2000, BankUnited extensively reviewed, modified and tested its systems prior to
the Year 2000, and has been substantially Year 2000 compliant since June 30,
1999.

     On and after January 1, 2000 and February 29, 2000 BankUnited conducted
extensive tests of its information systems to verify that the systems correctly
recognized the Year 2000 and treated it as a leap year. Additionally, BankUnited
associates have closely monitored computer output for accuracy subsequent to
January 1, 2000 and February 29, 2000. These tests and reviews have not resulted
in any incidents that would materially impact the operation or financial
condition of BankUnited, and BankUnited has not, as of this date, experienced
any significant disruption due to a Year 2000 failure.

     BankUnited incurred approximately $1.9 million in costs associated with
becoming Year 2000 compliant, excluding internal costs. The costs consisted of
approximately $0.7 million for the replacement of hardware and software, $0.9
million for the write-off of non-compliant hardware and software and $0.3
million for other incremental costs. BankUnited does not separately track the
internal costs incurred for the Year 2000 project and such costs are principally
the related payroll costs for its information systems department.

Discussion of Financial Condition Changes for the Years Ended September 30, 2000
and 1999

     Total assets increased 12.2% from $4.1 billion at September 30, 1999 to
$4.6 billion at September 30, 2000. The increase is mostly due to the increase
in loans.

     Loans. BankUnited's loans receivable, net (including loans held for sale)
increased $367.9 million from September 30, 1999 to September 30, 2000. Of
BankUnited's total net loans receivable of $3.7 billion at September 30, 2000,
$1.9 billion or 51.4% were adjustable-rate mortgages ("ARMs") and $1.8 billion
or 48.6% were fixed rate mortgages. Mortgage loan purchases of $5.5 million and
loan originations of $924 million were offset by repayments of $554.6 million
(net of accretion of discount and amortization of premium) and loan sales of
$10.2 million.

     Mortgage loans held for sale decreased $91 million to $312.6 million as of
September 30, 2000 as compared to $403.6 million at September 30, 1999
principally due to residential loan repayments of $95.1 million and sales of
$10.2 million. This decrease was partially offset by originations of loans held
for sale of $9.3 million.

                                       49
<PAGE>

     During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000, 1999, and 1998,
residential loans totaling $10.2 million, $23.6 million, and $173.5 million,
respectively, were sold for a gain of $71,000, a loss of $5,000, and a gain of
$4.0 million, respectively.

     Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Overnight Deposits. FHLB overnight deposits
increased $197.2 million to $247.6 million at September 30, 2000 from $50.4
million at September 30, 1999. This change is due to adjustments to BankUnited's
liquidity position in response to the growth in the balance sheet and projected
cash requirements.

     Securities Purchased Under Agreements To Resell. BankUnited had $63 million
in securities purchased under agreements to resell at September 30, 2000 .
BankUnited invest the unapplied proceeds of borrowings to maximize earnings
while maintaining liquidity until such time as loans and/or securities of a
price and quality in line with BankUnited's investment strategy become
available.

     Tax Certificates. BankUnited's investment in tax certificates decreased
$9.1 million, or 61.5%, to $5.7 million at September 30, 2000 from $14.8 million
at September 30, 1999. The decrease is a result of certificate redemptions and
repayments and the decision to discontinue investing in this line of business.

     Investments. Investments held to maturity remained consistent at $5.1
million as of September 30, 2000 and 1999. Investments available for sale
decreased $2.6 million, or 13%, to $17.4 million as of September 30, 2000 as
compared to $20.0 million as of September 30, 1999. The decrease in fiscal 2000
was primarily due to the maturity and redemption of investment securities.

     Mortgage-Backed Securities. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity
increased $19.8 million, or 9.8%, to $222.6 million at September 30, 2000 from
$202.8 million at September 30, 1999. The increase was due to purchases of GNMA,
FNMA, and FHLMC mortgage backed securities.

     BankUnited's available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio
decreased $24.6 million, or 17%, to $119.8 million as of September 30, 2000 from
$144.4 million as of September 30, 1999. This decrease was due to repayments and
amortization of $23.1 million, and a reduction of $1.5 million in the market
value of the underlying securities.

     Other Interest Earning Assets. Other interest earning assets increased $7.8
million, or 14.2%, to $62.7 million at September 30, 2000 from $54.9 million at
September 30, 1999. This category primarily represents stock in the FHLB which
BankUnited is required to purchase in proportion to FHLB advances.

     Deposits. Deposits increased by $329.7 million, or 14.5%, from $2.3 billion
at September 30, 1999 to $2.6 billion at September 30, 2000, due to an increase
in certificates of deposit accounts of $374 million and non-interest bearing
checking accounts of $22.2 million. The increases were offset by decreases in
passbook savings of $54.6 million, insured money market accounts of $2.3 million
and NOW accounts of $9.6 million.

                                       50

     Securities Sold Under Agreements To Repurchase. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase decreased by $22.5 million, or 71% to $9.2 million at
September 30, 2000 from $31.7 million at September 30, 1999 mainly due to
maturity of outstanding repurchase agreements which were not renewed.

     FHLB Advances. FHLB advances increased approximately $200 million, or 18.2%
to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2000 from $1.1 billion at September 30, 1999
mainly due to increased funding needs at the Bank.

     Senior Notes. Senior Notes remained at $200 million. These Senior Notes
were issued and sold during the second quarter of fiscal 1999. See Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

     Trust Preferred Securities. Trust Preferred securities decreased by $6.1
million or 2.8% from $218.5 million at September 30, 1999 to $212.4 million at
September 30, 2000. In November 1999, the Board of Directors of BankUnited
authorized the purchase from time to time in the open market, or otherwise, of
up to 300,000 shares of trust preferred securities issued by BankUnited's trust
subsidiaries. At September 30, 2000, BankUnited had purchased a total of 158,499
shares of trust preferred securities issued by its trust subsidiaries on the
open market at a cost of $4.4 million. A gain of $1.5 million, before taxes, was
recorded upon acquisition of these securities.

     Stockholders' Equity. BankUnited's total stockholders' equity was $202.6
million at September 30, 2000, an increase of $12.5 million, or 6.6%, from
$190.1 million at September 30, 1999. The increase is due primarily to current
year income after preferred stock dividends of $15 million and increase in
additional paid in capital of $357,000 offset by an increase in accumulated
other comprehensive loss of $1.8 million and $1.1 million in treasury stock.

     In May 1999, the Board of Directors of BankUnited authorized the purchase
of shares of the 9% Preferred Stock on the open market, as deemed appropriate,
and, if the market is appropriate, the retirement of the 9% Preferred Stock.
During fiscal 2000, BankUnited purchased a total of 1,000 shares of its 9%
Preferred Stock on the open market at a cost of $7,250.

     In December 1998, the Board of Directors of BankUnited authorized the
purchase from time to time in the open market, or otherwise, of up to 1,000,000
shares of BankUnited's Class A Common Stock at such prices as the Executive
Committee shall deem advantageous. This is in addition to the authority granted
to purchase shares for compensation and benefit programs. Through September 30,
2000, BankUnited purchased a total of 333,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock
on the open market at a cost of $2.8 million. As of the date of filing of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, no additional purchases have been made.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2000
and 1999

     Net Income after Preferred Stock Dividends. Net income after preferred
stock dividends increased to $15 million for the year ended September 30, 2000,
compared to a loss of $4.4 million for the year ended September 30, 1999. The
loss in fiscal 1999 was attributed to the restructuring charges. See
"Restructuring" above. The increase in net income after preferred stock
dividends for the year ended September 30, 2000 consisted of an increase in
interest and fees on loans of $61 million, a reduction in provision for loan
losses of $3.3 million, offset by an increase in interest expense of $31.6
million and an increase in tax expense of $12.2 million.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income before provision for loan losses
increased $30.1 million, or 65.4%, to $76.2 million for the year ended September
30, 2000 from $46.0 million for the year ended September 30, 1999. Net interest
margin increased to 1.91% for the year ended September 30, 2000, compared to
1.27% for the same prior year period. For the year ended September 30, 2000, the
increase in the net interest margin was due to an increase in the yield on
interest-earning assets to 7.39% from 6.44% in 1999, primarily attributable to
the increased yields on total loans, partially offset by a 33 basis point
increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 5.65% from 5.32% in
1999.

     Interest income increased $61.7 million, or 26.4%, to $295.3 million for
the year ended September 30, 2000 from $233.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 1999. Interest income for fiscal year 2000 was affected by the
increase in outstanding commercial and commercial real estate loans combined
with an increased annual interest rate yield of 9.19% as compared to 8.45% at
September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for commercial loans and 9.08% as
compared to 8.72% at September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for commercial
real estate.

     Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2000, increased $31.6
million, or 16.9%, to $219.1 million from $187.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 1999, primarily due to increases in interest expense on
interest-bearing deposits. Interest expense on interest-bearing deposits
increased $19.9 million, or 18.7%, to $126.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2000, from $106.7 million for the prior year as a result of an
increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits to $2.4 billion for
the year ended September 30, 2000, from $2.2 billion for the prior year, offset
by a 40 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing deposits to
5.18% for the year ended September 30, 2000, from 4.78% for the prior year.
Interest expense on the trust preferred securities decreased $255,000, or 1.2%
to $20.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $21.2 million for
the prior year, as a result of a decrease in the average balance of the trust
preferred securities to $215.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000
from $218.5 million for the prior year due to the acquisition of 158,499 shares
of these securities by BankUnited during fiscal 2000 .

     Other factors influencing the level of interest expense include the
issuance of the Bank's Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 1999,
which generated interest expense of $7.6 million for the year ended September
30, 1999 as compared to $11.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2000, at
a weighted average cost of 5.71%; and a $8.1 million increase in interest
expense on FHLB advances and other borrowings to $60.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2000 from $52.1 million for the prior year, resulting from
an increase in the average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowings to $1.0
billion for the year ended September 30, 2000, from $942.9 million for the prior
year. Overall, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased
33 basis points to 5.65% on an average balance of $3.9 billion for the year
ended September 30, 2000, from 5.32% on an average balance of $3.5 billion for
the year ended September 30, 1999.

     Yields Earned and Rates Paid. The following table sets forth certain
information relating to the categories of BankUnited's interest-earning assets
and interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated, including the effect
on yields of the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on the One-Year
CMT loan portfolio and a related security recorded in the first quarter of
fiscal 1999 and the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 due to the high
level of prepayments, the $14.8 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal
1999 related to the write-off of purchase premiums on the One-Year CMT loan
portfolio and the continuing accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on a
related security. All yield and rate information is calculated on an annualized
basis by dividing the income or expense item for the period by the average
balances during the period of the appropriate balance sheet item. Net interest
margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning
assets. Non-accrual loans are included for the appropriate periods, whereas
recognition of interest on such loans is discontinued and any remaining accrued
interest receivable is reversed, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and federal regulations. The yields and net interest
margins appearing in the following table have been calculated on a pre-tax
basis.

(1)  The yields and rates along with the corresponding interest rate spread and
     net interest margin represent the yields earned and rates paid on
     BankUnited's interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities,
     respectively, as of the close of business on September 30, 2000 and do not
     include any estimates of the effect accelerated amortization of purchased
     premiums would have on the yields earned.
(2)  The yields and rates along with the corresponding interest rate spread and
     net interest margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999 reflect
     the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on the One-Year CMT loan
     portfolio and a related security in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and
     the $14.8 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 1999 related to
     the write-off of purchase premiums on the One-Year CMT loan portfolio and
     the continuing accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on a related
     security. The yields and rates along with the corresponding interest rate
     spread and net interest margin for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1998
     reflect the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on the one-year
     CMT loan portfolio in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 1998.
(3)  Short-term investments include FHLB overnight deposits, securities
     purchased under agreements to resell, federal funds sold and certificates
     of deposit.

     Rate/Volume Analysis. The following table presents, for the periods
indicated, the changes in interest income and the changes in interest expense
attributable to the changes in interest rates and the changes in the volume of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. For each category of
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is
provided on changes attributable to: (i) changes in volume (change in volume
multiplied by prior year rate); (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied
by prior year volume); (iii) changes in rate/volume (change in rate multiplied
by change in volume); and (iv) total changes.

</TABLE>

(1)  Short-term investments include FHLB overnight deposits, securities
     purchased under agreements to resell, federal funds sold and certificates
     of deposit.

     Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses decreased $3.3
million to $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $7.9
million for the year ended September 30, 1999. Included in the $7.9 million
provision is a $6.3 million provision recorded in the second quarter of 1999 as
a result of management's review of interest earning assets. For a detailed
discussion of BankUnited's asset quality and allowance for loan losses, see
"Asset Quality."

     Non-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $1.3 million to $6.1
million for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $4.8 million for the
year ended September 30, 1999. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase
in service charges on deposits of approximately $276,000 and an increase in
service charges and fees on loans of approximately $744,000, and a $656,000
increase in sale of investment products through BUFC. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of approximately $400,000 of loan servicing
income, net of the amortization of loan mortgage servicing rights.

     Non-interest Expenses. Operating expenses increased $4.1 million to $52.5
million for the year ended September 30, 2000 compared to $48.4 million for the
year ended September 30, 1999. The increase in expenses is primarily
attributable to the increased staff levels necessitated by BankUnited's growth.

                                       55

     Income Taxes. The income tax provision increased to a net expense of $10.2
million, for the year ended September 30, 2000, compared to a net benefit of
$1.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1999. This increase was due to
BankUnited's strategic changes which increased income before taxes,
extraordinary item and preferred stock dividends to $25.1 million for the period
ended September 30, 2000 versus a loss of $5.5 million for the same period in
1999.

     Extraordinary Item. In November 1999, the Board of Directors of BankUnited
authorized the purchase, from time to time, in the open market, or otherwise, of
up to 300,000 shares of the Trust Preferred Securities. During fiscal 2000,
BankUnited purchased 158,499 shares of the Trust Preferred Securities, at a cost
of $4.4 million, resulting in an extraordinary gain as a result of their early
extinguishment in the amount of $0.9 million, net of $0.6 million in taxes.

Comparison of Operating Results for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 1999
and 1998

     Net Income after Preferred Stock Dividends. Net income after preferred
stock dividends decreased to a loss of $4.4 million for the year ended September
30, 1999, compared to net income after preferred stock dividends of $6.5 million
for the year ended September 30, 1998. The primary reasons for the decline in
net income after preferred stock dividends for the year ended September 30, 1999
were (i) the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on the One-Year CMT
loan portfolio and a related security recorded in the first quarter of fiscal
1999 due to the high level of prepayments; (ii) the write-off of purchase
premiums on the One-Year CMT loan portfolio, and the continuing acceleration of
amortization of purchase premiums on a related security in the second quarter of
fiscal 1999; (iii) the provision for loan losses in the second quarter resulting
from the re-evaluation of the loan portfolio; (iv) the provision for tax
certificate losses in the second quarter resulting from the increase in
nonperforming tax certificates and the decision to discontinue investing in this
asset; and (v) other miscellaneous charges in the second quarter including costs
associated with becoming Year 2000 compliant. See "Restructuring" above. A more
detailed discussion of each major category of income and expenses follows.

     Net Interest Income. Net interest income before provision for loan losses
increased $6.0 million, or 15.0%, to $46.0 million for the year ended September
30, 1999 from $40.0 million for the year ended September 30, 1998. This increase
was reduced as a result of the accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on
the One-Year CMT loan portfolio and a related security recorded in the first
quarter of fiscal 1999 and the $14.8 million charge in the second quarter of
fiscal 1999 related to the One-Year CMT loan portfolio and a related security.
This charge contributed to the reduction of the net interest margin to 1.27% for
the year ended September 30, 1999, compared to 1.32% for the same prior year
period. For the year ended September 30, 1999, the decrease in the net interest
margin was due to a decrease in the yield on interest-earning assets to 6.44%
from 6.86% for the same period in 1998, primarily attributable to the lower
yields on the loans purchased, partially offset by 43 basis point decrease in
the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 5.32% from 5.75% for the same period
in 1998.

     Interest income increased $26.0 million, or 12.5%, to $233.6 million for
the year ended September 30, 1999 from $207.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 1998. Interest income for the fiscal year 1999 was affected by the
following:

                                       56
<PAGE>

     The results of operations for the three months ended December 31, 1998
reflect the accelerated amortization of premiums on purchased loans and
mortgage-backed securities. The amortization of premiums, net of discounts and
deferred origination costs, increased from $1.0 million for the three months
ended December 31, 1997 to $6.1 million for the same period in fiscal 1999. The
increase in premium amortization was a result of the high level of loan
prepayments experienced in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The results of
operations for the three months ended March 31, 1999 include the $14.8 million
charge and $0.2 million of other amortization for a total reduction to interest
income of $15.0 million. The results of operations for the six months ended
September 30, 1999 include $2.8 million of amortization compared to $9.5 million
for the same period in fiscal 1998. The decrease is the result of the reduction
in the level of prepayments and the charge in the second quarter of fiscal 1999
to reduce the carrying value of the purchased One-Year CMT portfolio to the
lower of cost or market. The decrease in interest income due to these net
reductions was offset by an increase in the average balance of loans receivable,
which increased $0.5 billion or 20.1%, for the year ended September 30, 1999, as
compared to the same prior year period.

     Interest expense for the year ended September 30, 1999, increased $20.0
million, or 11.9%, to $187.5 million from $167.5 million for the year ended
September 30, 1998, primarily due to increases in interest expense on
interest-bearing deposits and the trust preferred securities. Interest expense
on interest-bearing deposits increased $13.3 million, or 14.2%, to $106.7
million for the year ended September 30, 1999, from $93.4 million for the prior
year as a result of an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing
deposits to $2.2 billion for the year ended September 30, 1999, from $1.7
billion for the year before, offset by a 58 basis point decrease in the average
cost of interest-bearing deposits to 4.78% for the year ended September 30,
1999, from 5.36% for the prior year. Interest expense on the trust preferred
securities increased $4.2 million, or 24.7% to $21.2 million for the year ended
September 30, 1999, from $17.0 million for the prior year, as a result of an
increase in the average balance of the trust preferred securities to $218.5
million for the year ended September 30, 1999 from $173.3 million for the prior
year.

     Other factors influencing the level of interest expense include the
issuance of the Bank's Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 1999,
which generated interest expense of $7.6 million for the year ended September
30, 1999, at a weighted average cost of 5.76%; and a $5.1 million decrease in
interest expense on FHLB advances and other borrowings to $52.1 million for the
year ended September 30, 1999 from $57.1 million for the prior year, resulting
from a decrease in the average balance of FHLB advances and other borrowings to
$942.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1999, from $998.6 million for
the prior year. Overall, the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities
decreased 43 basis points to 5.32% on an average balance of $3.5 billion for the
year ended September 30, 1999, from 5.75% on an average balance of $2.9 billion
for the year ended September 30, 1998.

     Provision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $6.2
million to $7.9 million for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to $1.7
million for the year ended September 30, 1998. Included in the $7.9 million
provision is a $6.3 million provision recorded in the second quarter as a result
of management's review of interest earning assets. The provision recorded in the
second quarter of fiscal 1999 relates to one-to-four family residential mortgage
loans ($2.1 million), indirect consumer loans ($0.3 million) and commercial
loans ($3.9 million). The provision for loan losses represents management's
estimate of the charge to operations after reviewing the nature,

                                       57
<PAGE>

volume, delinquency status, and inherent risk in the loan portfolio in relation
to the allowance for loan losses. For a detailed discussion of BankUnited's
asset quality and allowance for loan losses, see "Asset Quality."

     Non-interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $1.4 million to $4.8
million for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to $6.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 1998. The results reflect a $4.4 million decrease in
gains on sales of assets related to a reduction in the sales of loans and
mortgage-backed securities. Core income, comprised of net service fee income,
service charges and other fees on deposits and other non-interest income
increased $3.0 million reflecting BankUnited's increased emphasis on
implementing new products and services to meet customer needs.

     Non-interest Expenses. Operating expenses increased $16.2 million to $48.4
million for the year ended September 30, 1999 compared to $32.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 1998. Included in the increase in non-interest expenses
are the expenses incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 1999 for the
additional provision for tax certificate losses of $1.1 million, $1.0 million of
expenses related to Year 2000 compliance and $1.0 million of miscellaneous other
charges. The remaining increase in expenses is attributable to the growth
BankUnited has experienced, including the additional costs relating to the
acquisitions of Consumers Bancorp, Inc. and Central Bank during the second and
third quarters, respectively, of the 1998 fiscal year and the opening of two
additional branches in the 1999 fiscal year. Total non-interest expenses, as a
percentage of average assets, increased from 1.03% for the year ended September
30, 1998, to 1.28% for the same period in 1999 as a result of the additional
charges.

     Income Taxes. The income tax provision decreased to a net benefit of $1.9
million for the year ended September 30, 1999, compared to a net expense of $5.0
million for the year ended September 30, 1998. This decrease was due to
BankUnited's pre-tax loss during the year ended September 30, 1999, partially
offset by the increase in the effective income tax rate due to the effect of
non-deductible goodwill.

         Preferred Stock Dividends. Preferred stock dividends decreased $124,000
to $773,000 for the year ended September 30, 1999 as compared to $897,000 for
the year ended September 30, 1998. This decrease is the result of the retirement
in January 1998 of the 8% Noncumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series
1993, partially offset by the issuance of additional shares of Noncumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices.

     The financial statements and related financial data and notes presented
herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), which require the measurements of financial position and
operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in
the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.

     As a financial institution, virtually all of BankUnited's assets and
liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, BankUnited is not significantly
affected by the general levels of inflation. BankUnited's net income is mainly
dependent on the spread between the average yield earned on its interest-earning
assets and the average cost incurred on its interest-bearing liabilities.
Therefore, BankUnited's net income is more significantly impacted by changes in
interest rates (see Item 7a. "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk"). Although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same
direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, interest
rates are affected by actions of Federal Reserve designed to control inflation.

Item 7a.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

     As a financial intermediary BankUnited invests in various types of
interest-earning assets (primarily loans, mortgage-backed securities, and
investment securities) which are funded largely by interest-bearing liabilities
(primarily deposits, FHLB advances, and trust preferred securities). Such
financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market
interest rates that creates interest rate risk for the Bank. Accordingly,
BankUnited's net interest income, the most significant component of its net
income, is subject to substantial volatility due to changes in interest rates or
market yield curves, particularly if there are differences, or gaps, in the
repricing frequencies of its interest-earning assets and the interest-bearing
liabilities which fund them. BankUnited monitors such interest rate gaps and
seeks to manage its interest rate risk by adjusting the repricing frequencies of
its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Bank also uses
interest rate caps to limit its interest rate risk. In addition to reviewing
reports which summarize BankUnited's various interest sensitivity gaps,
management utilizes a simulation model which measures the financial impact
certain interest rate scenarios are likely to have on the Bank. As discussed
more fully below, a variety of factors influence the repricing characteristics
and the market values of BankUnited's interest-earning assets and
interest-bearing liabilities, but many of these factors are difficult to
quantify.

     The matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may
be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are
"interest rate sensitive" and by monitoring an institution's interest rate
sensitivity gap. An asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive
within a specific time period if it will contractually mature or reprice, or if
by management assumption, it is likely to be impacted by prepayments, run-off,
early withdrawal, or other such forces which can impact the timing and amount of
a given financial instrument's cash flows. An interest rate sensitivity gap is
the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets anticipated to
mature or reprice within a specific time period and the amount of
interest-bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within that same
period. A gap is considered to be positive when the amount of interest rate
sensitive assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame exceeds the
amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within that
same time frame. Conversely, a gap is considered to be negative when, within a
given period of time, the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds
the amount of interest rate sensitive assets. During a period where the general
level of interest rates is rising, a bank with a negative gap over that period
is likely to experience a decline in net interest income. Alternatively, a bank
with a positive gap will typically experience an increase in net interest
income.

Significant Assumptions Utilized in Managing Interest Rate Risk

     Assessing and managing BankUnited's exposure to interest rate risk involves
significant assumptions concerning the exercise of options which are considered
to be imbedded in many of the financial instruments on BankUnited's balance
sheet, the expected movement and relationship of various interest rate indices,
the impact of lag and cap risk, and the general availability of mortgages.

                                       61
<PAGE>

     Imbedded Options. A substantial portion of BankUnited's loans and
mortgage-backed securities are residential mortgage loans that contain an
imbedded option allowing borrowers to repay all, or a portion, of their loan
prior to maturity without penalty. The existence of this imbedded prepayment
option can adversely impact BankUnited's financial performance. In general,
marketable securities tend to exhibit an increase in market value when the level
of interest rates falls, and they tend to exhibit a decrease in market value
when the level of interest rates rises. Mortgage loans having imbedded
prepayment options, and the securities which contain them, do tend to decrease
in market value as interest rates rise. However increases in market value due to
a decrease in interest rates are typically suppressed since in a lower rate
environment borrowers are more likely to prepay, or refinance, their mortgage
loans. Consequently, the adverse impact an investment in mortgage loans or
mortgage securities may have on BankUnited's market value of equity, should
interest rates rise, may exceed the beneficial impact should interest rates fall
by a like amount.

     Additionally, in an increasing interest rate environment BankUnited's
funding costs may be expected to increase more quickly than would BankUnited's
earnings from its residential mortgage loan assets. This could result in a
deterioration in BankUnited's net interest margin. However, due to the asymmetry
discussed previously, improvement in BankUnited's net interest margin due to a
general decrease in interest rates, may be less than the deterioration in
BankUnited's net interest margin given a similar increase in the general level
of interest rates.

      A borrower's propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of
factors, some of which are: the loan's current interest rate versus the rate at
which the borrower would be able to refinance, the economic benefit expected to
be obtained from refinancing, the borrower's financial ability to refinance, the
availability of mortgage loans in general, and numerous other economic and
non-economic factors, some of which may vary by geographic region.

     With respect to ARM loans, a borrower's incentive to prepay or refinance
his loan is typically influenced by the interest rate index to which the
interest rate on his loan is tied, the amount by which the loan rate is to
differ from its associated index (the margin), the extent to which interest rate
caps (if any) are expected to limit future interest rate adjustments, the extent
to which payment caps (if any) are expected to limit future payment obligations,
and other less quantifiable factors.

     In an interest rate environment where long-term interest rates are
declining and related mortgage refinancing opportunities are readily available,
prepayments of ARMs and higher rate, fixed-rate mortgages tend to accelerate.
This was the case the first half of fiscal 1999. BankUnited's results of
operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 1999 reflect the accelerated
amortization of premiums on purchased loans and mortgage-backed securities due
to such refinancings. BankUnited continued to experience high levels of
prepayments in the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the effects of which are
included in the $14.8 million charge to write-off the remaining purchase
premiums on the One-Year CMT loan portfolio and to record the continuing
accelerated amortization of purchase premiums on a similar security. In
addition, $0.2 million of other amortization was recorded for a total reduction
to income of $15.0 million. During the third quarter of fiscal 1999, long-term
interest rates rose slightly resulting in a significant decrease in the level of
prepayments. As a result of this decline in prepayments and the reduction in the
balance of premiums to amortize in the second half

                                       62
<PAGE>

of fiscal 1999, the amortization of premiums, net of discounts and deferred
origination costs, decreased to $2.8 million for the six months ended September
30, 1999. As of September 30, 1999, BankUnited's purchased premiums, net of
discounts, were $3.5 million as compared to $866,000 at September 30, 2000.

     BankUnited has reviewed its practice of purchasing mortgage loans in the
secondary market, particularly ARM loans, and has put increased emphasis on
originating its own loans. Over time, management expects this to mitigate
BankUnited's exposure to the adverse impact accelerated premium amortization can
have on its net interest income

     Investment securities, other than those with early call provisions,
generally do not contain significant imbedded options that results in greater
degree of repayment predictability. While savings and checking deposits
generally may be withdrawn upon customer request without prior notice, on an
overall basis, one customer's withdrawal is likely to be offset by another
customer's deposit resulting in a dependable source of funds. Time deposits are
generally subject to early withdrawal penalties, which results in the large
majority of these deposits being maintained until maturity. Similarly, term FHLB
advances have prepayment penalties, which discourage early repayment by the
Bank. BankUnited's trust preferred securities may be redeemed at varying times
and $70 million of these securities may be redeemed through 2016 at a premium.
(See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the
trust preferred securities).

     BankUnited borrows from the FHLB in the form of advances to fund
operations. These advances have a variety of terms, rates and repayment
provisions. A significant portion of BankUnited's advances were obtained through
a convertible advances program that permits the FHLB to convert an advance from
a fixed-rate basis to a floating-rate basis at its discretion. It is highly
probable that the advances will be converted in a rising interest rate
environment. Should the FHLB elect to exercise this option, BankUnited's cost of
funds may be affected adversely.

     BankUnited also borrows under the "knockout" advance program offered by the
FHLB. In general, a knockout advance is structured as a fixed rate advance that
the FHLB may convert to a floating rate indexed to the 3-month LIBOR rate if, at
the end of any three month period after the non-conversion period, the 3-month
LIBOR rate equals or exceeds an agreed upon threshold rate. In general
BankUnited seeks to set the threshold at a rate that is higher than current
market interest rates. Should a particular advance be converted by the FHLB, its
rate will reset quarterly for the remainder of its term.

     BankUnited also limits its interest rate risk by purchasing interest rate
caps. At present BankUnited holds five interest rate cap contracts totaling $800
million. The contracts require the counter-party to pay the BankUnited quarterly
interest payments based on the notional amount and the difference between the
index and the cap rate, if and when the index exceeds the cap rate, in return
for a one time fee paid by the BankUnited (See Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion of interest rate caps).

     During fiscal year 2000, BankUnited borrowed a total of $250 million in
knockout advances, each with a 10-year term and a one year non-callable period.
The initial rates on these advances range from 5.92% to 6.94% while the
threshold rates range from 8.50% to 9.75%. BankUnited has chosen to borrow under
the knockout advance program because, as long as these advances remain

                                       63
<PAGE>

unconverted by the FHLB, the stability of BankUnited's net interest margin will
be enhanced. However, if the 3-month LIBOR rate were to rise so as to allow the
FHLB to convert one or more of BankUnited's knockout advances, the funding cost
associated with the converted advance would become higher and more volatile,
negatively impacting BankUnited's net interest margin.

     Interest Rate Indices. BankUnited's ARM loans and mortgage-backed
securities are primarily indexed to the One-Year CMT or MTA indices (see
"Business--Lending Activities"). To the extent such loans and mortgage-backed
securities are funded by deposits, FHLB advances, and other interest-bearing
liabilities whose interest costs are influenced by indices not highly correlated
with the One-Year CMT or MTA indices, an environment of changing interest rates
may impact the various indices differently which may lead to significant changes
in the value of, and the net earnings generated from, BankUnited's financial
instruments. Each index is unique, and as such, is uniquely influenced by
various economic and non-economic forces. Therefore, historical relationships
between various indices may not necessarily be indicative of future
relationships.

     Cap Risks and Lag Risks. At September 30, 2000 BankUnited's residential
loan portfolio included $1.5 billion of ARMs (40.5% of BankUnited's total loan
portfolio). The ARMs purchased by BankUnited typically have annual interest rate
adjustment caps that limit rate changes to 2% per year. Further, a portion of
these ARMs provide for initial rates of interest which are significantly below
the rates which would prevail were the contractual interest rate index and
margin used for repricing applied initially. Such loans are commonly referred to
as being in their teaser rate period.

     In times of sharply rising interest rates, these caps may serve to limit
the increase in interest income generated from certain interest-earning assets.
Conversely, in an environment of sharply falling interest rates, they may reduce
the decline in BankUnited's interest income. Over periods of time where the
general level of interest rates has had time to fluctuate, the alternating
positive and negative effects generated by such interest rate caps will be
largely offsetting. Over shorter periods, however, and to the extent any caps
are actually limiting the interest rate adjustment of any assets, they can
increase the volatility of BankUnited's net interest income, and to a lesser
extent, its market value of equity.

     Availability of Mortgage Loans. BankUnited's net income depends
significantly on its ability to originate or acquire mortgage loan assets on
acceptable terms and at favorable spreads over the its borrowing costs. Should
BankUnited be unable to originate or acquire such mortgage loans, its results of
operations will be adversely affected.

     In originating or acquiring mortgage loans, BankUnited competes with REITs,
investment banking firms, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage
bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, competing lenders, FNMA, FHLMC,
GNMA, and other entities which purchase mortgage loans, some of which have
greater financial resources than BankUnited. Increased competition for the
origination or acquisition of eligible mortgage loans or a diminution in the
supply could result in BankUnited having to incur higher costs eand accept lower
yields. This, in turn, would reduce the amount by which BankUnited's yield on
earning assets would exceeds its cost of funding those assets.

                                       64
<PAGE>

     The availability of mortgage loans meeting BankUnited's criteria is
dependent upon, among other things, the size and level of activity in the
residential real estate lending market, which in turn depends on other factors
including the level of interest rates, regional and national economic conditions
and changes in residential real estate values. To the extent the BankUnited is
unable to originate or acquire a sufficient volume of mortgage loans meeting its
criteria, BankUnited's operating results could be adversely affected.

     BankUnited's rate-sensitive liabilities maturing or subject to repricing
within one year exceed its rate-sensitive assets maturing or repricing within
the same period. As of September 30, 2000, this circumstance results in a
negative cumulative one-year gap position of 4.59% of total assets. This
mismatch, when coupled with the deregulation of the restrictions previously
imposed on the types of savings products that financial institutions are
permitted to offer, subjects BankUnited's earnings to change based on
fluctuations in interest rates. In terms of managing interest rate risk, one
method available to management is to attempt to more closely match the repricing
frequencies of the Bank's interest-earning assets to that of its
interest-bearing liabilities.

</TABLE>

(1)  In preparing the table above, certain, assumptions have been made with
     regard to the repricing or maturity of certain assets and liabilities.
     Assumptions as to prepayments on first and second mortgage loans and
     mortgage-backed securities were obtained from prepayment rate tables that
     provide assumptions corresponding to recent actual repricing experienced in
     the marketplace. Assumptions have also been made with regard to payments on
     tax certificates based on historical experience. Money market, NOW and
     passbook accounts are assumed to decay based upon duration estimates
     determined by management. The rates paid in these accounts, however, are
     determined by management based on market conditions and other factors and
     may reprice more slowly than assumed. All other assets and liabilities have
     been repriced based on the earlier of repricing or contractual maturity.
     The mortgage prepayment rate tables, deposit decay rates and the historical
     assumptions used regarding payments on tax certificates should not be
     regarded as indicative of the actual repricing that may be experienced by
     BankUnited.

                                       66
<PAGE>

     In addition to preparing and reviewing periodic gap reports which help
identify repricing mismatches, management uses simulation models which estimate
the impact on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios, balance
sheet trends and strategies. These simulations cover the following financial
instruments: short-term financial instruments, securities, loans, deposits,
borrowings and off-balance sheet financial instruments. These simulations
incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics, such as loan and deposit
growth and pricing, changes in funding mix and asset and liability repricing and
maturity characteristics. Simulations are run under various interest rate
scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital. From these
scenarios, interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are
developed and implemented. The overall interest rate risk position and
strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis by senior management. Based on the
information and assumptions in effect on September 30, 2000, management
estimates the impact of a gradual and parallel 100 basis-point rise or fall in
interest rates over the next 12 months to be between 4% and 8% of net interest
income.

     BankUnited recognizes that there are numerous assumptions and estimates
associated with the simulations described above which may not reflect the manner
in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In
this regard, the simulation model assumes that the composition of BankUnited's
interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period
remains relatively constant over the period being measured and also assumes that
the change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve
regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and
liabilities. In addition, prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the
model are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and, therefore, cannot be
determined with precision. For example, the unanticipated prolonged flatness of
the yield curve as well as the volatility in interest rates experienced over the
first six months of fiscal 1999 resulted in accelerated prepayments of loans and
a significant reduction in interest income. This led BankUnited, as part of its
restructuring strategy, to discontinue purchasing in the secondary market
One-Year CMT loans to reduce its exposure to such interest rate risks in future
periods. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations - Restructuring."

     Accordingly, although the simulation model may provide an indication of
BankUnited's interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such
measurements are not intended to provide for a precise forecast of the effect of
changes in market interest rates on BankUnited's net interest income and will
differ from actual results.

     BankUnited's operations are affected by many factors beyond its control
such as the overall condition of the economy, monetary and fiscal policies of
the federal government, and regulations specific to the banking industry.
Revenues generated from lending activities are impacted by loan demand, which in
turn impacts the interest rates at which such loans may be made, the supply of
housing, the availability of funds to lend, and the cost of obtaining such
funds.

     BankUnited currently utilizes, on a limited basis, derivative financial
instruments designed to reduce the interest rate risks associated with certain
other financial instruments. Specifically, Interest Rate Cap contracts have been
acquired by BankUnited to reduce its exposure to the increased funding costs
that would likely result in an increasing interest rate environment. As was

                                       67
<PAGE>

discussed previously, increased funding costs are not likely to be fully
counterbalanced by an offsetting increase in BankUnited's yield on interest
earning assets. (See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
discussion of the Interest Rate Cap contracts.) The Interest Rate Cap contracts
are treated as fair-value hedges and it is anticipated that any change in their
fair value will be substantially offset by an opposite change in the fair value
of the financial instruments intended to hedge.

     The indices used in these contracts are the Constant Maturity Treasury
("CMT") and the Constant Maturity Swap ("CMS").

     The following table sets forth information concerning the interest rate cap
contracts.

          --------
          $800,000
          ========

     BankUnited entered into these contracts for the purpose of hedging a
portion of BankUnited's interest rate risk against rising interest rates on
certain borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of September 30, 2000,
the 5-Year CMT rate was 5.82%, the 10-Year CMT rate was 5.77%, the 5-Year CMS
rate was 6.75% and the 10-Year CMS rate was 6.88%.

     There can be no assurance, however, of the degree to which BankUnited will
be able to match its short-term, interest-earning assets to its short-term,
interest-bearing liabilities. Neither can there be any assurances of
BankUnited's ability to manage related liquidity risks.

BankUnited Financial Corporation and Subsidiaries
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2000

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     The accounting and reporting policies of BankUnited Financial Corporation
("BankUnited") and subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the
savings and loan industry. Presented below is a description of BankUnited and
its principal accounting policies.

(a) Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of BankUnited
and its subsidiaries, including BankUnited, FSB (the "Bank"). The Bank provides
a full range of banking services to individual and corporate customers through
its branches in South and West Florida. The Bank is subject to the regulations
of certain federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by those
regulatory authorities. All significant inter-company transactions and balances
have been eliminated.

     The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date
of the consolidated statements of financial condition and operations for the
period.

     Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change
in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses,
the effect of prepayments on premiums on purchased loans, the valuation of
mortgage servicing rights, and the valuation of real estate acquired in
connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. Premiums (discounts)
on purchased loans are amortized (accreted) based, in part, on management's
estimate of future prepayment rates. If actual prepayments exceed these
estimates, premium (discounts) amortization (accretion) is increased (decreased)
through charges to interest income in the period the excess prepayments occur.
In connection with real estate owned, management obtains independent appraisals
for properties.

(b) Cash and Cash Equivalents

     For the purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash, Federal Home Loan Bank overnight deposits, and securities purchased under
agreement to resell with original maturities of three months or less.

(c) Mortgage-backed Securities and Investments

     Mortgage-backed securities and other investments available for sale are
carried at fair value, inclusive of unrealized gains and losses, and net of
discount accretion and premium amortization computed using the level yield
method. Net unrealized gains and losses are included in comprehensive income
(loss) net of applicable deferred income taxes.

     Mortgage-backed securities and investments held to maturity are carried at
amortized cost. Mortgage-backed securities and investment securities that
BankUnited has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
designated as held-to-maturity securities.

     Gains or losses on sales of mortgage securities and investments are
recognized on the specific identification basis.

     Tax certificates are considered investments held to maturity and,
accordingly, are carried at cost less a valuation allowance. Interest is accrued
on tax certificates until payoff or until deemed uncollectible. When deemed
uncollectible, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

(d) Allowance for Loan Losses

     A provision for losses on loans is charged to operations when, in
management's opinion, the collectibility of the balances is doubtful and the
carrying value is greater than the fair value, net of selling costs, of
collateral dependent loans or the estimated net realizable value of other loans.
The provision is based upon a review of the nature, volume, delinquency status
and inherent risk of the loan portfolio in relation to the allowance for loan
losses.

     Management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate. While
management uses historical and current available information to recognize losses
on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in
economic conditions. In addition, various regulatory agencies, as an integral
part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan
losses. Such agencies may require changes to the allowance based on their
judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.

     BankUnited's non-accrual policy provides that loans are placed on
non-accrual status when they are more than 90 days past due as to either
principal or interest. Loans are returned to accrual status when they become
less than 90 days delinquent.

(e) Loans Receivable

     Loans receivable are considered long-term investments and, accordingly, are
carried at historical cost. Loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of
cost or market, determined in the aggregate. In determining cost, deferred loan
origination fees and costs are adjusted to the principal balances of the related
loans.

(f) Loan Origination Fees, Commitment Fees, Loan Premiums and Related Costs

     Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest
income using the interest method over the contractual life of the loans,
adjusted for estimated prepayments based on BankUnited's historical prepayment
experience. Commitment fees and costs relating to commitments are recognized
over the commitment period on a straight-line basis. If the commitment is
subsequently exercised during the commitment period, the remaining unamortized
commitment fee at the time of exercise is recognized over the life of the loan
as an adjustment of yield.

     Premiums (discounts) paid on purchased loans are capitalized and recognized
as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans,
adjusted for estimated prepayments based on BankUnited's historical prepayment
experience. If actual prepayments exceed those estimated by BankUnited, premium
(discount) amortization (accretion) is increased (decreased) through charges to
interest income in the period the excess prepayments occur.

(g) Other Interest Earning Assets

     Other interest earning assets includes Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta
(FHLB) stock and an equity investment in the Community Reinvestment Group. The
fair value is estimated to be the carrying value which is par.

(h) Office Properties and Equipment

     Office properties and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the estimated
service lives of the assets for furniture, fixtures and equipment (7 to 10
years), and computer equipment and software (3 to 5 years), or with leasehold
improvements, the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement,
whichever is shorter. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to operations as
incurred, and improvements are capitalized.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

(i) Accrued Interest Receivable

     Recognition of interest on the accrual method is discontinued when interest
or principal payments are greater than 90 days in arrears. At the time a loan is
placed on non-accrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against interest income in the current period.

(j) Real Estate Owned

     Property acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is
recorded at the lower of the related principal balance at foreclosure or
estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell the property. Any excess of
the loan balance over the fair value less estimated costs to sell the property
is charged to the allowance for loan losses when the property is classified as
real estate owned. The carrying value is reviewed periodically and, when
necessary, any decline in the value of the real estate is charged to operations.
Significant property improvements which enhance the salability of the property
are capitalized to the extent that the carrying values do not exceed their
estimated realizable values. Maintenance and carrying costs on the property are
charged to operations as incurred.

(k) Impairment of Long-lived Assets

     Long-lived assets, assets to be disposed of and certain identifiable
intangibles, such as mortgage servicing rights, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
an asset may not be recoverable. In performing the review for recoverability,
BankUnited estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of
the asset and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying
amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized.

(l) Goodwill

     Goodwill is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated
beneficial life of 10 to 25 years. Goodwill is evaluated by management for
impairment on an annual basis based upon undiscounted cash flows of the related
net assets acquired.

(m) Income Taxes

     BankUnited and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns.
Deferred income taxes have been provided for elements of income and expense
which are recognized for financial reporting purposes in periods different than
such items are recognized for income tax purposes. BankUnited accounts for
income taxes utilizing the liability method, which applies the enacted statutory
rates in effect at the statement of financial condition date to differences
between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The resulting deferred
tax liabilities and assets are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws.

(n) Earnings (Loss) per Share

     Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. Earnings (loss) per common
share, assuming dilution, assume the maximum dilutive effect of the average
number of shares from stock options and the conversion equivalents of preferred
stocks and certain warrants.

(o) Stock Options

     Stock options are granted to employees and directors at the fair market
value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant. The proceeds from the
exercise of options are credited to common stock for the par value of the shares
issued, and the excess, adjusted for any tax benefit, is credited to paid-in
capital.

(p) Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131"), which requires
public companies to report certain financial information about significant
revenue-producing segments of the business for which such information is
available and utilized by the chief operating decision maker. Specific
information to be reported for individual operating segments includes a measure
of profit and loss, certain revenue and expense items, and total assets.
BankUnited adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 131 during the first quarter of
fiscal 1999. As the requirements of SFAS No. 131 are disclosure-related, its
implementation has no impact on BankUnited's financial position or results of
operations. As a community-oriented financial institution, substantially all of
BankUnited's operations involve the delivery of loan and deposit products to
customers. Management makes operation decisions and assesses performance based
on an ongoing review of these community banking operations, which constitute
BankUnited's only operating segment for financial reporting purposes.

     In October 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 134, "Accounting for Mortgage-Backed Securities Retained after the
Securitization of Mortgage Loans Held for Sale by a Mortgage Banking Enterprise"
("SFAS No. 134") which applies to mortgage banking enterprises and other
entities conducting similar operations. SFAS No. 134 requires that securities
retained after a securitization of loans held for sale be accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 115, unless the entity has entered into a commitment to
sell the retained securities before or during the securitization process. Such
securities would be classified as trading. SFAS No. 134 is effective for the
first fiscal quarter beginning after December 15, 1998. The adoption of SFAS No.
134 is reflected in the financial statements and has not had, and is not
expected to have, a material impact on BankUnited's financial position or
results of operations.

     The FASB has issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by
SFAS 137 and SFAS 138 (collectively, "SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 is effective for all
fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000; accordingly,
BankUnited adopted SFAS 133 on October 1, 2000.

     SFAS 133 requires that all derivative instruments be recorded on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are
recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income,
depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction
and, if it is, depending on the type of hedge transaction.

o    For fair-value hedge transactions in which the Bank is hedging changes in
     the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment, changes in the
     fair value of the derivative instrument are generally offset in the income
     statement by changes in the hedged item's fair value.

o    For cash-flow hedge transactions in which the Bank is hedging the
     variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate asset, liability, or a
     forecasted transaction, changes in the fair value of the derivative
     instrument are reported in other comprehensive income. The gains and losses
     on the derivative instrument that are reported in other comprehensive
     income are reclassified to earnings in the periods in which earnings are
     impacted by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item.

      The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period
earnings.

      Certain other derivative instruments used for risk management purposes do
not meet the hedge accounting criteria and, therefore, do not qualify for hedge
accounting. These derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with
changes in fair value recorded in the income statement. The Bank does not
utilize other derivative instruments for risk management purposes.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - (Continued)

(p) Impact of New Accounting Pronouncements (Continued)

During fiscal 2000, BankUnited purchased interest rate caps with a notional
amount of $800 million. These caps are used to hedge the interest rate risk
relating to the callable options of the FHLB advances (see Note 11).

     On October 1, 2000, in conjunction with SFAS No. 133, BankUnited accounted
for the interest rate caps as fair-value hedges and recorded a net of tax,
cumulative effect adjustment of $453,255 (gain) in earnings to recognize at fair
value all derivative instruments that are designated as fair-value hedging
instruments, offset by an adjustment of $453,255 (loss) in earnings to recognize
the difference (attributable to the interest rate risks) between the carrying
values and fair values of related imbedded call options in the FHLB advances.

     In September 2000, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 140 ("Statement No. 140") "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a replacement of FASB
No. 125" . Statement No. 140 revises the standards for accounting and reporting
of securitizations, other transfers of financial assets and extinguishments of
liabilities. The standards are based on a consistent application of a financial
components approach which focuses on control. Under that approach, after a
transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes financial and servicing
assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred. Derecognition of
financial assets occurs when control has been surrendered and liabilities are
derecognized when extinguished. Statement No. 140 is effective for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities occurring after
March 31, 2001. Other provisions of Statement No. 140 relating to recognition
and reclassification of collateral and disclosures of securitization
transactions are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2000. The
implementation of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on
BankUnited's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

(q) Financial Statement Reclassifications

     Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
September 30, 2000 consolidated financial statements.

(3) Acquisitions

     On January 23, 1998, BankUnited acquired Consumers Bancorp, Inc.
("Consumers") for approximately $12 million in a combination of cash and stock
and merged its wholly-owned subsidiary, Consumers Savings Bank, which had assets
of $104.4 million and deposits of $88.3 million as of January 23, 1998, into the
Bank. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in goodwill
of approximately $5.6 million. This acquisition did not have a material impact
on the financial condition or results of operations of BankUnited.

     On June 19, 1998, BankUnited acquired Central Bank ("Central"), for
1,386,000 shares of BankUnited's Class A Common Stock, and merged Central, which
had assets of $93.9 million and deposits of $65.9 million as of June 19, 1998
into the Bank. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in
goodwill of approximately $12.8 million. This acquisition did not have a
material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of
BankUnited.

(4) Tax Certificates

     Tax certificates are certificates representing delinquent real estate taxes
owed to the respective counties. A substantial percentage of tax certificates
are for properties located in southeast Florida. BankUnited's policy was to
purchase tax certificates only for properties located in Florida. As a result of
the review of interest earning assets in the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the
decision was made to discontinue purchasing tax certificates.

     The net carrying value of tax certificates was $5.7 million and $14.8
million at September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Included in these amounts
at September 30, 2000 and 1999 were $4.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively,
of tax certificates for which BankUnited had made application for tax deeds.
BankUnited maintains loss reserves for tax certificates that were $1.0 million
and $1.2 million at September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(5) Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell

     Interest income from securities purchased under agreements to resell
aggregated approximately $1.9 million, $6.1 million and $2.5 million for the
years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     The following sets forth information concerning BankUnited's securities

     The mortgage-backed securities have contractual maturities which range from
the years 2001 to 2031, however, expected maturities will differ from
contractual maturities as borrowers have the right to prepay obligations.

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, BankUnited transferred $158.9
million in mortgage-backed securities, with an aggregate market value of $156.4
million at the date of transfer, from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity.
The resulting $2.5 million unrealized loss was recorded as a discount and as a
component of other comprehensive income (loss) to be amortized over the life of
the related security in a manner consistent with premiums and discounts.

     There were no sales of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized
mortgage obligations during the years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999. Gross
proceeds on sales of mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage
obligations were $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 1998. Gross
realized gains were $423,000 on sales of mortgage-backed securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations during the year ended September 30, 1998.

     At September 30, 2000, GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC mortgage-backed securities with
market values of approximately $147 million were pledged as collateral for
public funds on deposit. At September 30, 2000, investment and mortgage-backed
securities with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $11.1 million were
pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements.

(11) Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank (Continued)

     The terms of a security agreement with the FHLB of Atlanta include a
specific assignment of collateral that requires the maintenance of qualifying
first mortgage loans as pledged collateral with unpaid principal amounts at
least equal to 100% of the FHLB advances, when discounted at 85% of the unpaid
principal balance. The FHLB of Atlanta stock, which is recorded at cost, is also
pledged as collateral for these advances.

(12) Senior Notes

     During November 1998, the Bank established a program to issue up to $500
million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes backed by an irrevocable
standby letter of credit of the FHLB of Atlanta. These notes may have either a
fixed or floating rate of interest determined at the time of issuance and will
mature no sooner than 9 months and no more than 10 years from the date of issue.
On February 2, 1999, the Bank issued and sold $200 million of Senior Notes which
mature five years from the date of issuance and bear interest at an annual rate
of 5.40%, payable semiannually.

(13) Company Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Trust Preferred Securities of
     Subsidiary Trust Holding Solely Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
     Debentures of BankUnited

     BankUnited Capital, BankUnited Capital II and BankUnited Capital III are
wholly-owned trust subsidiaries of BankUnited which were created under Delaware
law for the purpose of issuing Trust Preferred Securities and investing the
proceeds from the sale thereof in Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest
Debentures issued by BankUnited (the "Junior Subordinated Debentures").
BankUnited Capital, BankUnited Capital II and BankUnited Capital III issued
trust preferred securities in the aggregate amounts of $70.0 million, $46.0
million and $102.5 million, respectively, and issued common securities in the
aggregate amounts of $2.8 million, $1.8 million and $4.1 million, respectively.
All of the proceeds of the trust preferred securities and the common securities
were invested in the Junior Subordinated Debentures. The sole assets of each
trust are the Junior Subordinated Debentures.

     BankUnited Capital holds $70.6 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures
which pay a preferential cumulative cash distribution at an annual rate of
10.25% and mature December 31, 2026. BankUnited Capital II holds $47.6 million
of Junior Subordinated Debentures which pay a preferential cumulative cash
distribution at an annual rate of 9.60% and mature on June 30, 2027. BankUnited
Capital III holds $102.9 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures which pay a
preferential cumulative cash distribution at an annual rate of 9% and mature
March 31, 2028. In conjunction with the purchase and extinguishments of Trust
Preferred Securities, Junior Subordinated Debentures totaling $6.1 million were
also extinguished.

     The Trust Preferred Securities pay preferential cumulative cash
distributions at the same annual rate as the Junior Subordinated Debentures held
by the trust subsidiary issuer. Considered together, back-up undertakings made
by BankUnited with respect to the Trust Preferred Securities constitute a full
and unconditional guarantee by BankUnited of the obligations of the Trust
Preferred Securities.

     In November 1999, the Board of Directors of BankUnited authorized the
purchase, from time to time, in the open market, or otherwise, of up to 300,000
shares of trust preferred securities issued by its trust subsidiaries (the
"Trust Preferred Securities").

     BankUnited purchased 158,499 shares of Trust Preferred Securities at a cost
of $4.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2000. As a result of the
early extinguishment of the Trust Preferred Securities which were acquired, the
purchases resulted in extraordinary gains of $0.9 million, net of $0.6 million
in taxes, for the year ended September 30, 2000.

</TABLE>

     Under the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) regulations adopted to
implement the "prompt corrective action" provisions of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the "FDICIA"), a "well
capitalized" institution must have a risk-based capital ratio of 10%, a core
capital ratio of 5% and a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%. (The "Tier 1
risk-based capital" ratio is the ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets.)
The Bank is a well capitalized institution under the definitions as adopted.
Regulatory capital and net income amounts as of and for the years ended
September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998 did not differ from regulatory capital and net
income amounts reported to the OTS.

     Payment of dividends by the Bank is limited by federal regulations, which
provide for certain levels of permissible dividend payments depending on the
Bank's regulatory capital and other relevant factors.

     The pro forma results of operations reported above are not likely to be
representative of the effects on reported income of future years due to vesting
arrangements and additional option grants.

     The fair value of each option has been estimated on the date of the grant
using the Black Scholes option pricing model, with the following historical
weighted average assumptions applied to grants in fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998:

                                               2000        1999        1998

Expected life (in years).................     7.00         6.96         7.00

     Based upon the above assumptions, the weighted average fair value of
options granted during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $2,917,000, $3,993,000 and
$5,565,000, respectively.

     On September 7, 1999, the trustee of the 401(k) Plan and the trustees of
the Profit Sharing Plan approved a merger and transfer agreement between the
plans effective September 30, 1999. Under the terms of this agreement, the net
assets of the Profit Sharing Plan were transferred and assigned to the 401(k)
Plan as of September 30, 1999. The 401(k) Plan was then renamed the BankUnited
401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the combined plan,
eligible employees are permitted to contribute up to 15% of their annual salary
to the Plan. BankUnited currently intends to make quarterly matching
contributions at a rate of 75% of employee contributions, up to a maximum of 6%
of an employees' salary, in BankUnited's Class A Common stock. Employees are
eligible to participate in the plan after six months of service and begin
vesting in BankUnited's contribution after two years

meet the financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include commitments
to extend credit, purchase whole loans and securities, standby letters of credit
and derivative financial instruments. Those instruments involve, to varying
degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contract
or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement
BankUnited has in particular classes of financial instruments.

     BankUnited's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party on the financial instrument is represented by the contractual amount
and collateral value, if any, of those instruments.

     Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Total commitments to extend credit at
September 30, 2000 were as follows:

      BankUnited evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case
basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by BankUnited,
upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the
customer. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, property, plant
and equipment, residential real estate, and income-producing commercial
properties.

      Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by BankUnited
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees
are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as
that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. BankUnited requires
collateral to support those commitments.

      BankUnited currently holds five interest rate cap contracts with a major
Wall Street firm, having an aggregate notional amount of $800.0 million. Each
contract requires the counter-party to pay BankUnited quarterly interest
payments based on the notional amount and the difference between the index and
the cap rate, if and when the index exceeds the cap rate, in return for a
one-time payment by BankUnited. The indices used in these contracts are the
5-Year Treasury rate adjusted to a constant maturity (the "5-Year CMT rate"),
the 10-Year Treasury rate adjusted to a constant maturity (the "10-Year CMT
rate"), the 5-Year Constant Maturity Swap rate (the "5-Year CMS rate") and the
10-Year Constant Maturity Swap rate (the "10-Year CMS rate").

     BankUnited employs the services of a law firm, of which BankUnited's
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Office is senior managing director and
of which another director of BankUnited is managing director, and the services
of an insurance agency, of which a member of the Board of Directors is a vice
president. For the years ended September 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, total fees, a
portion of which were capitalized, paid to this law firm totaled approximately
$2.5 million, $2.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and premiums paid to
this insurance agency totaled approximately $523,000, $428,000 and $445,000,
respectively. Commissions are less than 15% of the premiums paid.

     In fiscal 1997, BankUnited leased property for a new branch, which is 25%
owned by BankUnited's Chairman of the Board. The lease is for a term of 3 years
with four, three year options to renew. The annual rent for the property is
approximately $121,000. Lease terms are comparable to those prevailing in the
area for similar transactions involving non-affiliated parties at the time that
the lease was signed.

(21) Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The information set forth below provides disclosure of the estimated fair
value of BankUnited's financial instruments. Management has made estimates of
fair value discount rates that it believes to be reasonable. However, because
there is no market for many of these financial instruments, management has no
basis to determine whether the fair value presented would be indicative of the
value negotiated in an actual sale. The fair value estimates do not consider the
tax effect that would be associated with the disposition of the assets or
liabilities at their fair value estimates.

     Fair values are estimated for loan portfolios with similar financial
characteristics. Loans are segregated by category, such as commercial,
commercial real estate, residential mortgage, second mortgages, and other
installment. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable
rate interest terms and by performing and non-performing status. The fair value
of loans, except residential mortgage loans, is calculated by discounting
scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market
discount rates that reflect the credit risk inherent in the loan. The estimate
of average maturity is based on historical experience with prepayments for each
loan classification modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of
current economic and lending conditions.

       For residential mortgage loans, fair value is estimated by discounting
contractual cash flows adjusted for national historical prepayment estimates
using discount rates based on a compilation of secondary market sources
published by the OTS in their "Asset and Liability Price Tables" for September
30, 2000.

     The fair value of the tax certificates is estimated at book value as these
investments historically have had relatively short lives and their yields
approximate market rates. The fair value of mortgage-backed securities and
investment securities is estimated based on bid prices available from securities
dealers.

     The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as
non-interest-bearing demand deposits, savings and NOW accounts, and money market
accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand. The fair value of
certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash
flows.

     The fair value of the 10-1/4% Trust Preferred Securities is estimated at
book value as these securities are privately-placed and have no active market.
The fair value of the 9.60% and 9% Trust Preferred Securities is estimated based
on quoted market prices.

     The fair value of borrowings, which include FHLB advances, securities sold
under agreements to repurchase and senior notes is determined by discounting the
scheduled cash flows through maturity using estimated market discount rates that
reflect the interest rate currently available in the market.

     The fair value of servicing rights is received from a third party provider
which determines the valuation of the asset in the market.

(21) Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments - (Continued)

     The fair value of the off-balance sheet financial instruments is estimated
based on the OTS's valuation as contained in its September 30, 2000 "Interest
Rate Risk Exposure Report" prepared for the Bank by the OTS from information
provided by the Bank. The fair value of interest rate caps is determined through
a third party valuation analysis.

                        BANKUNITED FINANCIAL CORPORATION

ARTICLE ONE

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

    1.1 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The annual meeting of stockholders of
BankUnited Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") shall be held during the
first four months after the end of each fiscal year of the Corporation at such
time and place, within or without the State of Florida, as may from time to time
be fixed by the Board of Directors; provided, however, that failure to hold the
annual meeting shall not work a forfeiture or affect otherwise valid corporate
acts.

    1.2 Special Meetings of Stockholders. Special meetings of the stockholders
may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board,
if any, the President, or any holder or holders of as much as 10% of all shares
of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting. Special meetings of the
stockholders shall be held at such time and place, within or without the State
of Florida, as may be determined by the person or persons calling the meeting.

    1.3 Notice. The Secretary or the officer or persons calling the meeting
shall deliver a written notice of the place, day and hour of all meetings of
stockholders, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the
meeting, either personally or by first class mail, to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be
delivered when deposited in the United States mail with first class postage
thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on
the stock transfer books of the Corporation. The notice of any special meeting
of stockholders shall state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is
called. Notice of any meeting of stockholders need not be given to any
stockholder who signs a waiver of notice, either before or after the meeting.
Attendance of a stockholder at a meeting, either in person or by proxy, shall of
itself constitute waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all
objections to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner
in which it has been called or convened, except when a stockholder attends a
meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting,
to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.

         If a meeting is adjourned for more than 30 days, or if after the
adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting.

    1.4 Fixing of Record Date. For the purpose of determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any
adjournment thereof, or stockholders entitled to receive payment of any
dividend, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other
proper purpose, the Board of Directors shall fix in advance a date as the record
date for any such determination of stockholders. Such date in any case shall be
not more than 60 days, and in case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than
10 days prior to the date on which the particular action requiring such
determination of stockholders is to be taken. When a determination of
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders has been made as
provided in this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment
thereof.

<PAGE>

    1.5 Voting; Presiding Officer. At all meetings of the stockholders, each
holder of shares of the capital stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to
cast such vote as he or she may have, either in person or by written proxy, for
each share standing in his or her name on the books of the Corporation. The
Chairman of the Board, or if there is no such officer, the President, shall
preside at all meetings of the stockholders, unless he or she delegates such
authority.

    1.6 Proxies. At all meetings of stockholders, a stockholder may vote by
proxy executed in writing by the stockholder or by his or her duly authorized
attorney-in-fact. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management shall be voted
as directed by the stockholder or, in the absence of such direction, as
determined by a majority of the Board of Directors. No proxy shall be valid
after three years from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in
the proxy.

    1.7 Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons. When shares stand
of record in the name of two or more persons, whether fiduciaries, members of a
partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants by the entirety or
otherwise, or if two or more persons have the same fiduciary relationship
respecting the same shares, in the absence of written directions to the
Corporation to the contrary, their acts with respect to voting, in person or by
proxy, shall have the following effect: (a) if only one votes, his or her act
binds all; (b) if more than one vote, the act of the majority so voting binds
all; and (c) if more than one vote, but the vote is evenly split on any
particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question
proportionally, or any person voting the shares, or a beneficiary, if any, may
apply to the appropriate Florida court or such other court as may have
jurisdiction to appoint an additional person to act with the persons so voting
the shares, which shall then be voted as determined by a majority of such
persons and the person appointed by the court. If the instrument so filed shows
that any such tenancy is held by unequal interests, a majority or even split for
the purpose of this subsection shall be a majority or even split in interest.

    1.8 Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Persons holding stock in a
fiduciary capacity shall be entitled to vote the shares so held. Persons whose
stock is pledged shall be entitled to vote, unless in the transfer by the
pledgor on the books of the Corporation he or she has expressly empowered the
pledgee to vote thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his or her proxy,
may represent such stock and vote thereon.

        Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the Corporation, nor
shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote
for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the
Corporation, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total
number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.

    1.9 Quorum: Adjournment. At all meetings of stockholders, the presence, in
person or by proxy, of shares of the Corporation representing at least a
majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business, and, except as otherwise required by
law or these Bylaws, all matters acted upon at such meeting shall require the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of the shares present at the meeting
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote. Directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes of the shares present at the meeting in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Where a separate vote
by a class or classes is required, the presence, in person or by proxy, of
shares representing at least a majority of the votes of such class or classes
entitled to vote on the matter shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action
with respect to that matter, and the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes
of the shares of such class or classes,

<PAGE>

present in person or proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter,
shall be the act of such class or classes. The holders of a majority of the
votes represented at a meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn
such meeting from time to time.

ARTICLE TWO

                                    DIRECTORS

    2.1 Powers of the Board. Subject to the Florida Business Corporation Act and
the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, the full and entire management of
the affairs and business of the Corporation shall be vested in the Board of
Directors, which shall have and may exercise all of the powers that may be
exercised or performed by the Corporation.

    2.2 Number of Directors; Conduct of Meetings. The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than five nor more than 20 members, such number within these
parameters to be set by the Board of Directors by resolution. Except with
respect to any directors elected by holders of one or more series of stock or of
preferred stock as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation or the resolutions
providing for the issuance of such stock, the Board of Directors shall be
divided into three classes of directors of as nearly equal numbers as is
possible, designated Class I, Class II and Class III, respectively, serving
staggered three-year terms, with the term of a class expiring at each annual
meeting of stockholders. Reflecting the Corporation's Reincorporation in Florida
in 1995, the terms of office of directors of Class III shall expire at the
annual meeting of stockholders in 1996, that of the directors of Class I at the
1997 meeting, and that of the directors of Class II at the 1998 meeting, and the
Board of Directors shall initially appoint the members of each class. At each
annual meeting of stockholders, a number of directors equal to the number of
directors of the class whose term expires at such meeting (or the number of
directors properly nominated and qualified for election) shall be elected to
hold office until the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after
their election. In all cases, each director shall serve until his successor is
elected and qualified, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal.

        A majority of said directors shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors. Except as
otherwise provided in these Bylaws, all resolutions adopted and all business
transacted by the Board of Directors shall require the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors present at the meeting.

        The Chairman of the Board, or if there is no Chairman of the Board, then
the Vice Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the Board of
Directors, unless he delegates such authority. If there is no Chairman of the
Board and the Vice Chairman of the Board is not a director, the directors shall
select a chairman for each meeting from their members.

    2.3 Vacancies. Except with respect to any directors elected by holders of
one or more series of stock or of preferred stock as set forth in the Articles
of Incorporation or the resolutions providing for the issuance of such stock,
vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
authorized number of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the remaining directors though less than a quorum of the Board of
Directors. As to any director elected by holders of one or more series of stock
or of preferred stock as set forth in the Articles of Incorporation or the
resolutions providing for the issuance of such stock, vacancies and newly
created directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of
directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of the holders of such series of
stock or preferred stock that elected such director, such action to be taken at
a meeting called for such purpose. The directors elected to fill a vacancy or a
newly created directorship resulting from an increase in the number of

<PAGE>

directors, shall hold office until the next annual election of directors by the
stockholders and the election and qualification of his successor.

    2.4 Meeting of the Board of Directors; Notice. The directors shall meet
annually immediately following the annual meeting of the stockholders; provided,
however, that the failure to hold the annual meeting shall not work a forfeiture
or affect otherwise valid corporate acts. Special meetings of the directors may
be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board or President, or by any two
directors, on two days' notice, which may be given personally or by first class
mail, telegram or cablegram and shall be deemed given when mailed or when the
telegram or cablegram is sent, addressed to the director at his address as it
appears on the stockholder records of the Corporation or, if he is not a
stockholder, to his business address. Notice of any such meeting may be waived
by an instrument in writing. Attendance of a director at a meeting shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting and waiver of any and all
objections to the place of the meeting, the time of the meeting, or the manner
in which it has been called or convened, except when a director states, at the
beginning of the meeting, any such objection or objections to the transaction of
business. Any meeting of the Board of Directors may be held within or without
the State of Florida at such place as may be determined by the person or persons
calling the meeting.

        Members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the
Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting thereof by means of conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in a meeting
pursuant to this by law shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

    2.5 Director Action Without a Meeting. Any action required to be taken at a
meeting of the directors, or any action that may be taken at a meeting of the
directors, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth
the action so to be taken and signed by all the directors, is filed with the
minutes of the proceedings of the directors.

    2.6 Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by sending a written
notice of such resignation to the principal office of the Corporation addressed
to the Chairman of the Board or the President. Unless otherwise specified
therein, such resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof by the Chairman
of the Board or the President.

    2.7 Compensation. The Board of Directors shall have the authority to fix the
compensation of directors, which compensation may include reasonable expenses of
attendance, if any. The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to
compensate members of either standing or special committees for their attendance
at committee meetings.

    2.8 Presumption of Assent. A director of the Corporation who is present at a
meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any corporate matter is
taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless his or her
dissent or abstention shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless
he or she shall file his or her written dissent to such action with the person
acting as the Secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or shall
forward such dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation
within five days after the date he or she receives a copy of the minutes of the
meeting. Such right to dissent shall not apply to a director who voted in favor
of such action.

proposed to be transacted at the meeting.

    3.5 Quorum. A majority of the members of the Executive Committee shall

a majority of the members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present.

meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member.

    3.8 Resignations and Removal. Any member of the Executive Committee may be
removed at any time with or without cause by resolution adopted by a majority of
the full Board of Directors. Any member of the Executive Committee may resign

President or Secretary of the Corporation. Unless otherwise specified thereon,
such resignation shall take effect upon receipt. The acceptance of such
resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

    3.9 Procedure. The Executive Committee shall elect a presiding officer from
its members and may fix its own rules of procedure which shall not be

and report the same to the Board of Directors for its information at the meeting

party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the Corporation's request as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such
action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he
or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

    10.2 Derivative Actions. The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was
or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a
judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the
Corporation's request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or
settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a
manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation and except that no indemnification shall be made
under this Section if such person shall be adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation, unless and only to the extent that the applicable Florida court or
the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the appropriate Florida court or such other
court shall deem proper.

    10.3 Expenses. To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in Sections 10.1 and 10.2, or in defense

expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or
her in connection therewith.

    10.4 Requirements. Indemnification under Sections 10.1 and 10.2 (unless
ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2.

          Such determination shall be made:

               (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
          consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or

or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or other enterprise against any
liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such
capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability
under the provisions of this Article 10.
