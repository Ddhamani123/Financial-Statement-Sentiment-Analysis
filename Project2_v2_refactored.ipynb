    "# Project 2\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Your job in this project is to calculate a number of statistics for real-life firms using the SEC EDGAR system. To get started, you will want to look at the examples in the Topic 2.1 notebook on Canvas. There is nothing about the questions that I am asking that limits us to filings from 1998 through 2000. However, doing so minimizes the likelihood that you'll need to remove html tags from the 10-K filings that you process in question 3.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Question 1a.</b> Use master.idx available on EDGAR to create a list of CIKs for firms that file a 10-K in the fourth quarters of 1998, 1999, and 2000. This is obviously a subset of the firms that file a 10-K in each of these calendar years.\n",
    "- <b>Question 1b</b>. Use the SEC's current mapping from tickers to CIKs (provided below) to determine how many of the CIKs in question 1a currently have a ticker. (I am not asking you to verify that the CIK belongs to the same firm today that it did in 1998-2000; I don't know the SEC's policy on re-using CIKs.)\n",
    "- <b>Question 2a</b>. For the CIKs from question 1a, how many 8-K were filed during each month of 1999? How many 8-Ks were filed on each day of the week during 1999?\n",
    "- <b>Question 2b.</b> Calculate summary statistics based on the number of 8-Ks filed during 1999 by the CIKs from question 1a.\n",
    "- <b>Question 3.</b> Pick one of the CIK from question 1a at random and measure the sentiment of item 1 of its 10-Ks from 1998, 1999, and 2000.\n",

Worst case, you can use different regular expressions on the different years. <i>Hint: Before attempting to extract multiple lines of text, it is helpful to replace the '\\n' line returns with '|' or some other delimiter.</i>\n",
